Geography was my favorite subject at school. All the concepts and theories used to fascinate me a lot. Reading about Solstice's, Equinox's, Eclipse's, and many other things always used to make me think if only I could ever witness these wonders.

In 2017 we got a chance to be at the Tropic of Capricorn in Chile for the first time. But we missed the summer solstice only by a few hours.
So the Sun is directly overhead at Tropic of Capricorn (90 degrees elevation) on Dec solstice. This day marks the shift in the direction of the Sun's movement. It appears to halt its southerly course when it reaches this latitude and begins moving back to the north. At that moment, objects that stand straight up (flagpoles, telephone poles, etc.) cast no shadow. Our shadow is beneath us.

I forever desired to experience this amazing phenomenon, and this time, we were indeed determined not to miss it. Days of planning and so much effort went into this as it did not fit into our schedule at all. After reworking the plan several times, we lastly came up with "THE PLAN" and finally made it. (I must admit Chile is the most challenging country to plan if you decide to travel on your own)

In 2019, Dec Solstice or the summer solstice in the southern hemisphere happened at 1:22 pm Antofagasta time. Yes, not 12:00 pm, I always thought that the Sun is overhead at noon, but it happens at what is called the solar noon, not the clock noon. Solar noon may or may not be the same as clock noon. Solstices occur at the same time around the world, but their local times vary with time zones.

It was so cool to see our shadows disappearing, a joy to behold!


So mark your calendar for the next Solstice and witness the Sun on this astronomically significant day.
