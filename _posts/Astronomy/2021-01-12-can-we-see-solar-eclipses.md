## Mercury and Venus
Neither of them has a moon. Even if they had one, it would be challenging to cover the entire surface of the sun by their moons, since they are too close to the sun.

## Earth
For a solar eclipse to happen on Earth, it has to be very precise; the moon distance and size has to be unique. But Solar Eclipses on Earth will not always remain since the moon is moving away from Earth 4cm a year. So in 600 million years, we won't have total Solar Eclipse on Earth.

## Mars
It has 2 moons, Phobos & Deimos, which can never create a total solar eclipse because of their smaller size. Mars could only observe annular eclipses. In fact, Curiosity rover filmed one of the partial eclipses.

## Jupiter
It has as many as 79 moons, 53 are named and 26 awaiting official names. Since it is far away from the Sun and has 4 large enough moons, total solar eclipses are happening on Jupiter. In fact, in 2004 Hubble telescope captured 3 Solar eclipses happening at the same time on different parts of Jupiter. This also makes us conclude that we can have more than 1 eclipses at the same time.

## Saturn
Like Jupiter Saturn also witnesses a lot of Solar eclipses in certain seasons. Yes, Saturn has seasons, it's axis is tilted as like Earth, but it takes around 29 earth years once to go around the sun.
Also, some of the solar eclipses on Saturn are unique because of its rings.

## Uranus
Solar Eclipses are rare for Uranus, they could only be seen around the equinox. Unlike the solar system's other planets, Uranus is tilted almost entirely on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees. Its moons, however, orbit the icy giant above its equator. So because of it's enormous tilt and perfect alignment with the orbital plane, the equator is only illuminated around the two equinoxes, during the 84-year revolution around the Sun. Which makes Solar eclipses a rare occurrence for Uranus.

In 2006, Hubble captured a rare eclipse on Uranus during its equinox.

## Neptune
Neptune's inner moons and Triton can create a total solar eclipse.
Although eclipses on Neptune are rare due to the planet's long orbital period and large axial tilt of 28 degrees. The largest moon, Triton, has an orbital inclination of about 25 degrees to Neptune's equator. Even when such an eclipse does occur, it passes rather quickly, as Triton moves in the opposite direction of Neptune's spin.

Also, it's pretty dark on Neptune because of the planet's distance from the Sun. Neptune only receives 1/900th of the light Earth does, the Sun looks like any other star out there.
