## Where to look?

For those of you eager to witness this celestial spectacle, keep your gaze fixed on the eastern horizon to locate Venus, the most radiant point in the celestial tapestry :)

Now, shift your attention to the left, where the luminous star Capella graces the heavens. Just below Capella, you'll find Neowise, a celestial visitor easily discernible without the aid of telescopes or binoculars.

Note that Neowise will become visible in the evening sky starting from July 12 onwards. Approximately an hour after sunset, direct your gaze towards the northwestern sky, and you'll spot it nestled just beneath the constellation of the Big Dipper.

If you're not using binoculars or small scopes, finding the comet will be even easier during the pre-dawn hours, around 4:30 AM, as the sky will be darker and provide better visibility.
