## Where to look?

For those of you who are planning to observe this celestial splendor, look for Venus in the eastern sky, which is easy to spot being the brightest :)<br>
Look towards the left, there is a bright star Capella, Neowise will be below it. It is very much visible to the naked eye.
<br><br>
Note it will become visible in the evening sky after July 12. Look towards the northwestern sky about an hour after sunset; it just sits below the big dipper.

If not using binoculars or small scopes, it will be more easier to locate the comet pre-dawn(around 4:30ish) since the sky would be darker.
