*August 21, 2017*

On the memorable day of October 24, 1995, I was just an eight-year-old child filled with curiosity and wonder as I eagerly anticipated my first-ever encounter with a total solar eclipse. What made this experience even more extraordinary was that it occurred on the next day of Diwali, the Festival of Lights in India.
I recall that we embarked on an all-night journey to witness this celestial spectacle. We chose to park our cars on a bridge, providing us with an unobstructed 360-degree view of the sky. It became our front-row seat to the heavens.

It was a perplexing moment because, in theory, I had some knowledge of what was about to happen, but in practice, I was entirely uncertain about what to anticipate. Then, as if by magic, the sun seemed to devour the moon, plunging us into darkness in the midst of broad daylight. It left me utterly spellbound. The sight of the sun's corona, the emergence of stars in the daytime sky – I couldn't believe my eyes. I was left awestruck, wondering, "What just happened?" It was an experience of pure wonder. There's truly nothing on this planet that compares to the phenomenon of a total solar eclipse; it stands alone as a unique and unparalleled experience. Even 22 years later, the memory remains vivid, and I still feel that same sense of awe and wonder.

Today the United States witnessed one of the most brilliant and splendid phenomena that can well be imagined. From Oregon to South Carolina, the first total solar eclipse visible from coast to coast across the United States in 99 years.  Our good fortune led us to Madras, Oregon, where we had the privilege of witnessing this celestial spectacle. I am particularly delighted that we orchestrated this trip because I yearned for my husband to experience what had left an indelible impression on me 22 years ago.<br><br>
The atmosphere was nothing short of frenzied, as thousands of tourists descended upon cities and towns across the country in pursuit of a glimpse of this extraordinary Great American eclipse. In the early hours of the morning, at 5:30 am in Oregon, everyone hit the road, each seeking their own perfect vantage point to etch this moment into their memory for a lifetime. Desiring solitude away from the bustling crowds, we decided to pull over at the roadside, accompanied by only two other cars. All of us stood there, patiently waiting for this extraordinary event to unfold before our eyes.

The totality lasted 2 minutes, and we could sun flares and see Baily's beads effect. Everything around us seemed to hold its breath, enveloped in an almost eerie calmness. It was a complete sensory spectacle, and I found myself yearning to soak in every single detail.<br><br>
My husband had questioned me multiple times before this event, asking what it was like to witness a total solar eclipse. Each time, I stumbled over my words, finding it nearly impossible to convey the depth of emotion I felt. Indeed, trying to articulate that sensation was an elusive task. You simply know it when you see it, but putting it into words is an endeavor that falls short. Now, having experienced it firsthand, my husband found himself in wholehearted agreement.

Totality, those special minutes of darkness are something very unique and extraordinary as a human experience. After experiencing it two times can’t wait to see it again.
