October 24, 1995, I was an eight-year-old kid when I saw the total eclipse of the sun for the first time, it was more special because it coincided with Diwali, the festivals of light in India.
I remember we had to drive all night to see this ultimate astronomy event. We parked our cars on a bridge to get a 360 view of the sky.

It was confusing because theoretically, I knew what it was, but practically I didn’t know what to expect. And then suddenly the sun gulped the moon and it became dark in the middle of the day, it just left me in awe. You could see the sun's corona, stars, I couldn't believe like, what just happened? It was truly breathtaking.
There is simply nothing else in the world like a total solar eclipse, and it is unlike any other type of experience one can have. 22 years later today, I still feel the same.

Today the United States witnessed one of the most brilliant and splendid phenomena that can well be imagined. From Oregon to South Carolina, the first total solar eclipse visible from coast to coast across the United States in 99 years. We were fortunate to make it to Madras, Oregon, to observe this magnificent event. I am glad that we could plan this trip as I really wanted my husband to experience what I did 22 years ago.<br><br>
It was like madness, thousands of tourists have flocked to cities and towns across the country to catch a glimpse of this Great American eclipse. Everyone was on the road today by 5:30 am in Oregon today, trying to find their perfect spot to create a lifetime memory. We wanted to be away from the crowds, so we pulled over by the side of the road, there were only two other cars, everyone waiting for it to happen.

The totality lasted 2 minutes, and we could sun flares and see Baily's beads effect. It was so still and calm, a total sensory spectacle, I just wanted to absorb everything. My husband would ask me several times before this, how does it feel like seeing a total solar eclipse, and I always fell short of words. In fact, it is very difficult to describe that emotion. You just know it, but you can't explain it. And now he couldn't agree more.

Totality, those special minutes of darkness are something very unique and extraordinary as a human experience. After experiencing it two times can’t wait to see it again.
