Zodiacal Light or 'False Dawn or Dusk' is a white glow visible in the eastern or western sky before dawn and after dusk. This faint glow extending up from the horizon is from the scattering of sunlight off the cloud of tiny dust particles orbiting the Sun.

Zodiacal Light is the brightest around equinoxes. In the Northern hemisphere, the best way to see it in springtime is to look for it in the western sky after sunset. And in autumn, just before dawn in the eastern sky. Find a dark spot and observe on a moonless night.

This one is from early April this year.
