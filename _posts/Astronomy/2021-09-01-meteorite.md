title: 'Metorite- From holding it once to owning it now'

description: My whole point of getting into amateur astronomy was my fascination, no actually obsession, for meteors. Back in the 90s, I saw some pictures of meteor showers. It was one of those stacked photos which had multiple meteors falling from the sky. So my brain had only registered that image of the showers. My two biggest dreams were to see Everest and meteor showers at least once in my lifetime. So my quest continued; after moving to Delhi in 2010, I started researching how to watch them and where to see them. That's how I found AAAD (Amateur Astronomer Association of Delhi) in 2012, and there I learned what really meteor showers were( not the picture I had imagined all those years). Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see them in India, and it was finally in 2015 I was fortunate enough to see them in California (and what better way to start this journey than seeing the Perseids). Now every year, at least we try to catch these celestial fireworks if there is no moon.

<b><i>"Is anyone interested in holding this piece of rock?"</i></b> - I heard a voice from across the hall at Griffith observatory.<br>



<b><i>"This is no ordinary rock,"</i></b> he said again. Of course, it is, I thought to myself. It's in the observatory; it surely must be an ancient rock. Usually, such things are off-limits, so I decided to go up to this gentleman and imagined how cool it would be to hold one of them. He started explaining about the rock.<br>

The rock was not a common one; it was not even from the earth, oh my gosh!!! It was a meteorite - A Space Rock. I didn't know how to contain my excitement. (hence some funny/weird looks in picture below).<br>

<b><i>"Can I hold it? Are you really serious, so I can take it from you just like that",</i></b> I asked him nervously.<br>

<b><i>"Of course you can; just be careful it is pretty heavy."</i></b> Meteorites are very deceiving. It didn't look bulky, but it was very, very heavy; I could not hold it for hold for long (thinking that I would drop it).<br>

<b><i>"OMG. OMG. OMG. This is unbelievable."</i></b><br>

It was a joy to behold, in one moment when you feel this is it, and in the other, you are like, am I daydreaming?<br>

My whole point of getting into amateur astronomy was my fascination, no actually obsession, for meteors. Back in the 90s, I saw some pictures of meteor showers. It was one of those stacked photos which had multiple meteors falling from the sky. So my brain had only registered that image of the showers. My two biggest dreams were to see Everest and meteor showers at least once in my lifetime. So my quest continued; after moving to Delhi in 2010, I started researching how to watch them and where to see them. That's how I found AAAD (Amateur Astronomer Association of Delhi) in 2012, and there I learned what really meteor showers were( not the picture I had imagined all those years). Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see them in India, and it was finally in 2015 I was fortunate enough to see them in California ([and what better way to start this journey than seeing the Perseids](https://wayfaringuniverse.com/astronomy/perseids-over-the-years)). Now every year, at least we try to catch these celestial fireworks if there is no moon.<br><br>

If seeing them was my greatest dream, then owning one of them was a far-fetched idea. Meteorites cost a fortune, and also since there is no independent authority that guarantees authenticity, it isn't very straightforward to buy them. A beginner like myself would never be able to differentiate between a space rock or the earthly ones. But in December of 2019, we were in Chile and decided to visit Museo Del Meteorito in San Pedro de Atacama. It's a small museum with various kinds of meteorites in the exhibitâ€”a very impressive collection. Buying from a well-known and trustworthy dealer is very important. The Atacama desert is a perfect place for discovering meteorites firstly because there is no vegetation, and secondly, the climatic conditions are such that the weathering is very minimal. That's how I finally became a  proud owner of a meteorite( a piece of Vaca Muerta).<br><br>
