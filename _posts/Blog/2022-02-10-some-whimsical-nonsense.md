When you and your best friend are into some crazy Victorian shit. And when all the 'sense and sensibility' (bad pun) have gone out of the window.

For so many years, we would discuss literature and poetry like pseudo-intellectuals over the phone all the time. And how we would always fancy doing this in person. Just to get together and read and have tea. For the love of reading and that era. So finally, when this happened, I think the both of us were elated. It was so much fun. And oh my god, the way you read Jane Eyre, you totally nailed it. I was in awe of you 18 years ago, when we first met, and I am still in awe of you Saher. Glad to have you!

Trying to recreate that look of victorian #behenhood seemed more like a #failedrecreation. ğŸ˜‚ Couldn't stop laughing, seeing ourselves in the mirror after dressing up. Aiming for Annas, Beatrices, Elizabeths, Janes, Emmas, our first reactions were -

a) we look like midwives of that era

b) you being a distant aunt who has taken me under your wings to groom for better prospects of marriage.

c) you being some aristocratic lady with your head maid ( an outlier - treating the poor with kindness and respect)

d) and if we had bonnets, it would be more like -

Me: "Blessed be the fruit."
You: "Under his eye."

I wish we had more time and at least finished a book and lived in this state of uninterrupted wonder.
But as you perfectly quoted a version of Suess earlier -

"Don't be sad because it's over. Be happy because it happened."

Next -> Sycorax and Caliban
