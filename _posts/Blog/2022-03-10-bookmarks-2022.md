# Citizen

This book is a piece of art!! Not poetry, not essays just abstract & it all makes sense. Dealing with deep systemic problems in a more contemporary setting. I would say this is my first hyperlinked book. There is a lot that is not explicitly said but readers are encouraged to to delve into the details through bibliography, through images, through blank spaces. Very impressed by the writing of the book, reminded me of Caste by Isabel Wilkerson.<br><br>
There are so many sections that blew my mind. But one that really stood out for me was where she beautifully weaves the Zidane's World Cup finals with anecdotes from some important people.
And gosh!! ending with a Turner painting and those images in the book, just sheer brilliance.<br><br>

The purpose of art," James Baldwin wrote, "is to lay bare the questions hidden by the answers." He might have been channeling Dostoyevsky's statement that "we have all the answers. It is the questions we do not know."

When I heard the song "tu kisi rail si" from the movie 'Masaan' for the first time it just blew my mind away. I always thought the lyrics to be Varun Grover's, didn't know all these years that these captivating words arefrom Dushyant Kumar. And the entire song is based on his poetry. Pure Gold.

This book shines a light on life and times of the people of Lucknow. It has a strong sense of melancholy - but in a beautiful way, something that any person would relate to.
