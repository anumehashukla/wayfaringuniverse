### 2. Takakkaw Falls
Takakkaw Falls is amongst the highest waterfalls in Canada. You can see the falls from the road as you drive into the Valley. There is a small trail from the parking lot that leads up to the base of the falls. As you get closer, you can feel the mist from this powerful waterfall. Get ready to be sprayed. Accessible mid-June until mid-October to small vehicles and bicycles only due to steep, tight switchbacks.
Takakkaw Falls is a glorious place to visit for any reason. Whether it’s to go for a hike or just enjoy the surroundings, any reason is a good reason.

### 4. Wapta Falls
Wapta Falls is a short, easy 2.4 Km (total 4.8 Km) hike in Yoho National Park.The trail through the woods is mostly flat with minimal elevation gain. If you are visiting in winters, the access road to the trailhead may be closed. Check beforehand.
If you are up for a short hike, these falls are a must.

Note: Type Wapta Falls trailhead in google maps instead of Wapta falls, since it takes you to the other side of the river.
Also the trailhead is not marked for westbound traffic on Trans-Canada Highway, as there is no left turn lane here. Continue 3 km to the park west boundary, turn and come back.
