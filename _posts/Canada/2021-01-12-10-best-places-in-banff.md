## 1.  Peyto Lake
<br>

---

The lake is fed from the Peyto Glacier to the left of the viewpoint and this gives the lake a magnificent blue color in the summer months due to the mineral content. This glacier is part of the extensive Wapta Icefield, which straddles the Continental Divide and extends into the northern reach.<br>

<br>

<mark> The best views of the lake are from the Bow summit</mark>
* **Bow Summit Lookout Trail** starts at the Peyto Lake viewing platform and is around 6 km roundtrip. From the parking lot, follow the trail up to the Peyto Lake viewing area(wooden platform), then turn left and head up the hill on the paved trail. At a 3 way junction, take the middle path. As the trail levels off you will pass a signpost. Straight ahead a gravel road leads off the paved trail. Follow this old fire lookout road as it switchbacks up the mountain with ever increasing panoramas of the valley below. There are several trails leading off the road to various impromptu viewpoints, but the best is saved for the old lookout spot, at which point your views are south to Bow Lake and beyond, and north past Peyto to the Waterfowl Lakes and beyond.

***Note:** To avoid the crowds arrive early in the morning or late in the afternoon or early evening when the tour buses have gone through for the day.*
