Banff National Park was the first national park (third in the world) in Canada. It was established in 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve. It is located in the Rocky Mountains and is part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage site. The park was expanded in 1887 and was then named Rocky Mountains Park,later to be known as Banff  National Park. Hundreds of kilometres of hiking trails traverse high mountain passes, turquoise glacial lakes, plunging waterfalls and steep canyons.

### 1.  Peyto Lake

The lake is fed from the Peyto Glacier to the left of the viewpoint and this gives the lake a magnificent blue color in the summer months due to the mineral content. This glacier is part of the extensive Wapta Icefield, which straddles the Continental Divide and extends into the northern reach.
#### The best views of the lake are from the Bow summit
* Bow Summit Lookout Trail starts at the Peyto Lake viewing platform and is around 6 km roundtrip. From the parking lot, follow the trail up to the Peyto Lake viewing area(wooden platform), then turn left and head up the hill on the paved trail. At a 3 way junction, take the middle path. As the trail levels off you will pass a signpost. Straight ahead a gravel road leads off the paved trail. Follow this old fire lookout road as it switchbacks up the mountain with ever increasing panoramas of the valley below. There are several trails leading off the road to various impromptu viewpoints, but the best is saved for the old lookout spot, at which point your views are south to Bow Lake and beyond, and north past Peyto to the Waterfowl Lakes and beyond.

Note: To avoid the crowds arrive early in the morning or late in the afternoon or early evening when the tour buses have gone through for the day.

### 2. Moraine Lake
The Twenty Dollar View.
Moraine Lake, a glacier-fed lake is located in the beautiful Valley Of The Ten Peaks. Though the view is more than a million dollar but the iconic image of the Lake and the Valley Of The Ten Peaks was used on the back of Canadian twenty dollar bills issued between 1969 and 1979.
<br>
Trailhead: starts from the lower end of the parking lot across the bridge on the outlet stream.<br>
Distance: 350 meters<br>
Elevation: easy elevation of 30 meters<br>
Time: 40 minutes of return trip<br>
The Rockpile Trail Offers the Best View of Moraine Lake. It is a short trail of less than half a kilometre with minimal elevation gain. The trail switchbacks along the back of the moraine bringing you to the top of the rocks where there are fantastic views overlooking the lake.
