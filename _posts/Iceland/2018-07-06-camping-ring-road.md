Wild Camping has been banned in Iceland since 2015, please spend the night on  a camgound only. Also, the advantage of sleeping in a campground is you a get tons of facilities - restrooms, showers, kitchen etc.<br>
No need to book any site in advance (except groups at some sites)<br>

Here are some of my favourite campgrounds along the ring road.<br><br>

Restroom price included in camping fee, for visitors(non campers) it is 200 kr<br>
Has 3 restaurants on site(Skógar Street Food, Bistro Bar, Center Fossbud Restaurant)<br>
Electricity<br>
It's just next to Skogafoss, the most iconic waterfall in Iceland.
The parking lot is common for both visitors and campers. You need to park your RV or campervan on the gravel<br>
Also, it is always crowded but most of the cars(visitors) leave by 10 pm<br>


The site is awesome, but amenities are not, restrooms were really filthy. I would say not the best site for camping.<br>

Okay, so you take showers in the guesthouse on the other side of the campground. I think it was not a guesthouse but somebody's home, probably the people who worked at the restaurant or on the farm. But can't complain, it was the by far the best bathroom in Iceland, super clean, warm and big :)<br>
The cooking area was small, unlit and smelly, so we cooked outside.
