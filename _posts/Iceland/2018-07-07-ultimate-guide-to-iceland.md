Traveling to Iceland and wondering what are the main highlights of Iceland, how much time you need to visit this beautiful country, and what’s the best itinerary to follow? Are there any fuel stations along the ring road? What are the cheap grocery places? In this post, I am sharing our experience-based suggestions and itinerary ideas for ten days.


## Best time to visit Iceland
 There is a saying in Iceland, “If you don´t like the weather, just wait 5 minutes”. That is so true; it could be sunny one moment and raining on the other. But basically, the weather is **cold, cloudy and windy,** for most of the year. To put it simply, there is no single best time. Each period has its advantages and shortcomings, so deciding when to go is entirely up to you. However, I consider that summer would be a strong contender for the best time to visit Iceland as it is the warmest time of year. Of course, with promised long days and the fabled midnight sun ideal for hiking, sightseeing or road tripping, but with not without hordes of crowds.

Here's an overview of the weather in Iceland:

#### Summers
July - Aug are certainly the best months to go to Iceland in terms of temperatures and daylight hours although prices will be at a premium as will the crowds. The average temperatures during summers range between 50-55s (10-13 degrees Celsius) in the southern part and a bit lower in northern Iceland.
If you are **visiting Iceland for the first time, I would unquestionably recommend doing it in summers.**

#### Shoulder Season
Spring and Fall are also a good time to visit Iceland. Crowds have gone, temperatures are not that cold, prices are dramatically lower for airfares, accommodation, and car rentals. And, also you have Northern Lights. What else could you ask for, better than the dancing lights in the sky with a picturesque backdrop?
Iceland's peak season for the **Northern Lights** is between September and March. But the months of February to March, and September to October – particularly around the equinoxes – are the best months to see Aurora Borealis.  The Northern Lights are best viewed during a Solar Maximum.  So, Solar maximum is the peak of periodic 11-year Solar cycle(Sun's activity - radiations, flares, and spots). The last peak was in 2013, and the next won't occur again until about 2024. But that doesn't mean you can't see the lights during a low. The northern lights appear at every stage of the Solar cycle. It's just the intensity and visibility that is low, and the probability of seeing lights is narrow during Solar Minimum. Approximately the duration of one cycle is 11 years, although it can be anything up to 14 or 15 years. So plan accordingly!
September is undoubtedly a great time to visit this Nordic fairyland.

#### Winters
Although this is arguably the most challenging time of year to visit, winter in Iceland produces captivating sceneries. Everything covered in snow and having all vistas and space almost entirely to yourselves.  January is the coldest and darkest month of the year. If visiting in January and February, make sure you wrap up warm particularly if you’re heading in search of the Northern Lights.
Expect cold temperatures, snow flurries, low visibility, and road closures.

## Visa
Iceland is a member of the Schengen Visa Agreement, all persons [requiring visas,](http://utl.is/index.php/en/who-needs-a-visa) not holding a valid Schengen visa in their travel document, must apply for a visa at the applicable embassy/consulate before traveling to Iceland.

## Iceland road trip itinerary

[Here is a 10 day road trip itinerary along ring road](http://wayfaringuniverse.com/iceland/ring-road)

## [Ring road clockwise or counterclockwise?](){: name="ringRoadClockwise"}
There’s not really a wrong way to drive the ring road; either way is gorgeous. There is no one correct answer.

All the sights will remain where they are, whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise. Therefore hardly matters which way you choose. But definitely, some parts like - the first glimpse of the town of Akureyri is unbeatable when you are driving in the counterclockwise direction. While the views of Vatnajökull(*it is visible from far away, in fact, we could see it's four terminus's, together*) are best seen when traveling clockwise. So there will always be some sections which would be better in one direction while the rest in other.

It also depends on where you manage to get accommodation, that could help you decide the direction.

It's easy to pull over or stop at all the scenic points in Iceland, unlike other places. For example, if you are doing California 1, you would always want to do it from North to South, rather than the other way around since all the scenic overlooks are on the right side of the road. And being mostly a single lane highway, with lots of blind turns,  pulling over the left side of the road would be complicated. We are bound to choose north to south direction.
But there is no such problem in Iceland. So, you are free to pick any direction.

The only reason, **I would do it counterclockwise** is because there are so many stops in the south and you might be too exhausted already, to really enjoy them on your way back to Reykjavík. Again, it entirely depends on your individual preference.

## Fuel

FUEL = EXPENSIVE

Yes, gas is expensive in Iceland. It cost us around 500 USD approximately to do the entire ring road in a campervan. If you are planning to do the ring road or venturing into the F -roads, if you are below half a tank, I would suggest filling up gas whenever you pass a gas station.

The gas stations in Iceland have everything from a restaurant, a grocery store, retail store, restrooms. We enjoyed several meals at **Nesti** (I  fell in love with their Veggie Burger :) ) by N1 stations.
I would strongly advise buying some snacks or coffee or any other stuff if you are using their restrooms.

Most of the **gas stations only accept credit cards with a pin,** make sure you know the pin of your credit card or carry a debit card. Alternatively, you can buy a pre-paid gas card at the beginning of your trip. You can also pay at the gas station if they are manned and open(during business hours).
So, if you don't have the pin and the gas stations are closed or unmanned, you won't be able to fill up gas.

Major gas station companies are N1, Orkan, Olis, etc. Below is an interactive map of significant gas stations in Iceland.
Many rental car companies give a discount tag that works at one of these stations. Ask your rental car company about the discount.

**Note: Unlike the United States, the diesel pumps in Iceland have black handles while gasoline ones are green.**

## [Grocery/ Supermarkets](){: name="Grocery"}

Just like gas, food is also expensive in Iceland. Reykjavik has a lot of options but as you step outside would advise, stock up in Reykjavik if you are hitting the Ring Road or Highlands or especially camping. Get all the stuff that you might need on your trip, in Reykjavik, and only buy perishables along the journey. That way you could save some money, and furthermore, make your trip hassle-free from all the time trying to locate a grocery store.

Bónus is the budget supermarket in Iceland, and it is the cheapest of all. They have stores all across Iceland. Refer to the map below for locations. Others stores that are popular in Iceland are  Kronan, Netto, Hagauap, Noatun, Samkaup, Vidir.

Gas Stations across Iceland also have small grocery stores(sometimes bigger ones as well). You will always find what you are looking for, don't worry about the tidbits.

## Electrical Outlets
The sockets and power plugs are of type F in Iceland or also called Europlug/Schuko-Plug. The outlet's output 230 volts versus 110 volts in the U.S. So, get your converters/adapters, if necessary. Alternatively, you can buy them at Keflavik Airport or various gas stations across Iceland.

## SIM
You can buy SIM at Keflavik airport itself, just outside the arrivals.<br>
Síminn has the best coverage.
