Iceland’s Ring Road encircles the entire country covering over 1300 km on Route 1 or Highway 1. While you could technically drive the whole thing in less than 24 hours, the truth is it will take you at least a week with stops on along the way.

This is because you’ll be stopping a lot. Like every 5 minutes!

Renting a car for your Iceland road trip is essential. Sure, there are bus tours that drive the route, but a self-drive tour gives you a lot of flexibility. You can stop anywhere you want, for as long as you want, giving you complete freedom.

We rented a three-person Camper Van from [Camp Easy](https://www.campeasy.com) and had an amazing experience. It is also much cheaper than Happy Campers. I would highly recommend Camp Easy.
<br>
The major benefit of renting a camper is that it covers your accommodation too, enabling you to pull over and sleep pretty much anywhere. No need to set up a tent or find a hotel!
<br><br>
Also, it was only the two of us(my husband and I) traveling, but we still rented a three-person van. Believe me, it was the best decision we made. Almost every camper we met along the road had so many space issues. Most of their vans were chaotically stuffed. The extra space saved so much of time, and it was super easy to operate inside the camper. Not to forget how comfortable it was to have all that extra space while sleeping. We met someone on one of the campsites; they described sleeping in a two-person camper as being completely mummified, with no space to move :)

If you are hitting the ring road, it would be wise to stock up all the grocery and other stuff in Reykjavik itself. *[Find out more about grocery shopping here](/iceland/ultimate-guide-to-iceland#Grocery){: .js-no-ajax}*

You might have seen many mighty waterfalls in the world, but ever imagined going behind one of them. Iceland is a magical place, and Seljalandsfoss is one of its magic. Seljalandsfoss is one of the most famous and photographed waterfalls in Western Europe. <br>

Gljufurarfoss is just next to Seljalandsfoss; it is a canyon waterfall.

<br>
 It is also the trailhead for Fimmvörðuháls hike (also referred to as the Fimm hike). The highlight of this hike is able to walk through a wide variety of panoramas within a day: beginning at the ocean, going up past 26 waterfalls to lush tundra, then across a volcanic plain home to some of the world’s most recent volcanic activity.<br>

## 3. Reynisfjara beach / Reynisdrangar

This is a **deadly beach**, where several travelers have lost their life due to the hazardous waves that sneak up on people without any notice. Be well aware of the potential dangers present at the beach.

<br>
The waves of Reynisfjara & Kirkjufjara are known as sneaker waves. They are particularly violent, often pushing far further up the beach than many would expect. People are advised to **never turn their back on the waves** and keep a safe distance of 20-30 meters. <br><br>

<br><br>
# DAY 7
## 1. Dettifoss waterfall

Dettifoss is reachable by two separate roads, by Route 864 on the East and Route 862 on the west, depending on which side of the falls you want to be on. If you're going to get to the east side, the road (Route 864) is not that great, its a gravel road. While the other "west side" is considerably better. The distance between the two sides is quite a bit, so choose accordingly. (66 KM between the two parking areas )
There is a stark difference between the two sides; the east side is all rocky while the west is lush green due to the mist falling from the waterfall on the west side. Also, you can walk right up to the base of the falls( very close, I mean you can just stand next to the waterfall, not to mention it is also very dangerous), while on the other side which is also close to the falls you get a more grandeur view of the falls and often beautiful rainbows.

## 2. Selfoss waterfall
Selfoss and Dettifoss are just adjacent, 7 mins apart, easy walk.
