Iceland’s Ring Road encircles the entire country covering over 1300 km on Route 1 or Highway 1. While you could technically drive the entire thing in less than 24 hours, the truth is it will take you at least a week with stops on along the way.

This is because you’ll be stopping a lot. Like every 5 minutes!

Renting a car for your Iceland road trip is essential. Sure, there are bus tours that drive the route, but a self-drive tour gives you a lot of flexibility. You can stop anywhere you want, for as long as you want, giving you complete freedom.

We rented a 3 person Camper Van from [Camp Easy](https://www.campeasy.com) and had a really amaming experience. It is also much cheaper than Happy Campers. I would highly recommend Camp Easy.
<br>
The major benefit of renting a camper is that it covers your accommodation too, enabling you to pull over and sleep pretty much anywhere. No need to set up a tent or find a hotel!
<br><br>
Also, it was only two of us(my husband and I) travelling but still we rented a 3 person van, believe me, it was the best decision we made. Almost every camper we met along the road had so many space issues. Most of their vans were chaotically stuffed. The extra space saved so much of time and it was super easy to operate inside the camper. Not to forget, how comfortable it was to have all that extra space while sleeping ( we met someone on one of the campsites, they described sleeping in a 2 person camper as being completely mummified, with no space to move :) )

If you are hitting the ring road, it would be wise to stock up all the grocery and other stuff in Reykjavik itself. *[Find more about grocery shopping here](/iceland/ultimate-guide-to-iceland#Grocery){: .js-no-ajax}*

# Day 2

## 1. Seljalandsfoss waterfall and Gljufurarfoss waterfall

You might have seen many mighty waterfalls in the world, but ever imagined going behind one of them. Iceland is a magical place and Seljalandsfoss is one of its magic. Seljalandsfoss is one of the most famous and photographed waterfalls in Western Europe. <br>

Gljufurarfoss is just to Seljalandsfoss, its a canyon waterfall.

  Sólheimasandur Plane Wreck is a wrecked DC-3 Plane on Sólheimasandur. It'a 4km( 8 km roundtrip) easy walk from the parking lot on Route 1.

## 3. Skógafoss
  There are two viewpoints for Skogafoss. One is just from parking to the base of waterfall. The other is 1/2 km uphill from the parking lot.
  <br>
  It is also the trailhead for Fimmvörðuháls hike (also referred to as the Fimm hike). The highlight of this hike is being able to walk through a wide diversity of landscapes within a day: starting at the ocean, going up past 26 waterfalls to grassy tundra, then across a volcanic plateau home to some of the world’s most recent volcanic activity.<br>

## 3. Reynisfjara beach / Reynisdrangar

  This is a **deadly beach**, where a number of travellers have lost their life due to the extremely dangerous waves that sneak up on people without any notice. Be well aware of the potential dangers present at the beach.
  <br>
  <br>
  The waves of Reynisfjara & Kirkjufjara are known as sneaker waves. They are particularly violent, often pushing far further up the beach than many would expect. Visitors are advised to **never turn their back on the waves** , don't go chasing after them and keep a safe distance of 20-30 meters. <br><br>
  PLEASE stay safe, even if the waves look to be far away they can sweep you away in a second so maintain a safe distance.

  There is a restaurant on the beach.
  Toilets available.

# Day 7
## 1. Dettifoss waterfall

Dettifoss is reachable by two different roads, depending on which side of the falls you want to be on. If you want to get to the "Prometheus" side, the road is not that great, its a gravel road. But if you want to get to the other - west - side, the road is considerably better going north from the Ring Road.
