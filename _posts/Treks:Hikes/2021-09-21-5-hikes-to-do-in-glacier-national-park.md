Glacier National Park has over 700 miles of hiking trails. I have picked up five hikes which is a varied selection of moderate and easy hikes.

## Points to note

* <mark>Bear Spray.</mark> Carry Bear Spray. Be sure you know how to use it. (there are tons of youtube videos on this). Stow bear spray inside your backpack (not in the side pockets) when you are not hiking. This prevents an accidental discharge in crowded areas and otherwise. Please note Bear sprays are not allowed either in carry-on or checked-in luggage.
* <mark>Waterproof hiking shoes.</mark> Proper footwear is necessary. Wear waterproof hiking shoes.
* <mark>Layered clothing.</mark> - since the weather conditions could change quickly.
* <mark>Water & snacks.</mark> Bring plenty of water and snacks to stay hydrated and energized.
* <mark>Offline Maps.</mark> Although all the popular trails are well-marked and crowded, having offline maps on the phone could sometimes be helpful.

## 1. Grinnel Glacier Hike
<br>

---

##### Distance : _11.2 miles_, Elevation Gain : _1800 ft_

An 11.2-mile hike with 1800 ft of elev gain in the Many Glaciers region. It's the number one hike in Glacier National Park. Panoramic views of the lake Josephine and Grinnel lake. A must-do!

You can take off 3 miles from the entire hike by taking a boat across Swiftcurrent and Lake Josephine. It's a small boat ride; we took the 8:30 a.m. Scenic Tour, and it was $33 per person ($35 in 2022). Book your boat rides from the [Glacier Boat Company](https://glacierparkboats.com/) by choosing Many Glaciers as the tour location. Round trip tickets guarantee a return boat trip however, seating is on an availability basis. Restrooms are not available on the boats.
<br>

If you have a boat tour reservation at Many Glacier and would like to travel the Going-to-the-Sun corridor during the high season, a ticketed entry reservation will be required; boat tour reservation is not valid to enter the park.

## 3. St. Mary and Virginia Falls Trail
<br>

---

##### Distance : _4 miles_, Elevation Gain : _520 ft_

Alltrails shows the trailhead at the St Mary Shuttle stop, but I am afraid that section is closed as of Sept 2021, and you can't park there. So instead, park at St Mary Falls Parking lot. Nice hike, multiple waterfalls. Virginia falls is definitely the highlight of the hike.

## 4. Paradise Point Trail
<br>

---

##### Distance : _1.6 miles_, Elevation Gain : _160 ft_

Paradise Point trail is in the Two Medicine Lake area. I would highly recommend doing it either around sunrise or sunset. It's an easy hike with gorgeous views of Two Medicine Lake.

## 5. Running Eagle Falls Nature Trail
<br>

---

##### Distance : _0.6 mile_, Elevation Gain : _negligible_

Nice short, well-marked hike/walk. Unique waterfall coming out of a rock. Most of the trail is paved. It is also wheelchair accessible.
