Got to see a lot of downtowns - Tiburon, San Anselmo, Livermore, Fairfax, Hayward, Corte Madera, Saratoga

#### Here is a list of hikes in Bay Area. <i>[See these on Map](/unitedstates/bay-area-hikes#trailheadsMap){: .js-no-ajax}</i>

1. [Tomales Point Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tomales-point-trail)
<br>10 miles out and back trail, no shade. One of the best trails we did this year. Excellent hike! Lots of Elks, amazing views at the end and all throughout. We encountered a snake as well, and saw one of the coolest sunset ever.
I highly recommend this one!!
<br>
<br>
2. [Berry Creek Falls Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/berry-creek-falls-trail?ref=result-card)
<br>It's a 13 mile moderately hard trail with lots of shade. Great workout hike. Took us 4hrs 13 mins to complete it. Make sure to have some snacks & enough water, it's a strenuous hike. Also have the trail map handy beacuse if you get lost or take some detour it will add more miles and time and only make it harder.
<br>
<br>
3. [Fall Creek and Lost Empire Trail Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/fall-creek?ref=result-card)
<br>11 mile hard trail, lots of shade. I felt this was more harder than the Berry Creek Falls trail, although it is marked 'moderate' on alltrails. Again carry plenty of water and food, and download an offline map.
<br>
<br>
4. [Rodeo Valley Loop and Slacker Hill](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/rodeo-valley-loop-and-slacker-hill?ref=result-card)
<br> 6.2 miles moderate hike, gradual elevation gain, no shade. Black Sands Beach via Julian Trail and this trail share the same trailhead. Also this is a loop so you can start from some other trailhead. 5 years of living in the bay area and not been to Slacker hill, I know that's embarrasing. :)
<br>The viewpoint is super amazing, awesome views of the GGB, city, ocean and the bay. A must do! Just avoid weekends.
<br>
<br>
5. Fordyce falls via Spaulding Lake trail 10 mile
<br>
<br>
6. [Old Springs, Miwok, Wolf Ridge, Coastal and Tennessee Valley Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/old-springs-miwok-wolf-ridge-coastal-and-tennessee-valley-loop)
<br>4.9 miles, almost no shade. This trail and Tennessee Valley trail share the same trailhead. We did this hike on a weekday, though it is not a popular trail but the parking lot was almost full around 6:00 pm when we reached. I guess most of the traffic was for Tennessee Beach and other hikes that start from this trailhead. We only came across a handful of people on the trail. If you are looking for a less crowded hike on a weekday, I would certainly suggest this one.
<br>
<br>
7. [Milagra Overlook Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/milagra-overlook-trail)
<br>2.8 mile easy roundtrip trail. A few steep sections. We started it from the Connemara dr parking lot instead of Sharp Park Road trailhead. Parking is very limited at both the trailheads. It was beautiful at sunset, you get sweeping views of the Ocean and Pacifica. We came across only 4-5 people.
<br>
<br>
8. [McNee Ranch to Planet of the Apes](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mcnee-ranch-to-planet-of-the-apes)
<br>Nice hike! Mostly not shaded. Couple of steep sections. I would suggest wearing proper footwear since comingf down could be a problem. Very limited parking at the trailhead on Highway 1, could only fit about 6 car or so. But you can always park at the Montara State Beach parking which is just .2 miles from the trailhead. Alltrails shows a an inaccurate distance of 4.8miles. Did it counterclockwise and it happened to be around 5.8 miles (moderately difficult counterclockwise)
<br>
<br>
9. [Sweeny ridge via Mori ridge (5.2 miles) ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/sweeney-ridge-trail-via-mori-ridge?ref=result-card)
<br>
<br>
10. [Mount Tamalpais Middle Peak Loop Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/mount-tamalpais-middle-peak-loop-trail)
<br>It is 5.8ish but alltrails shows 5.3 miles. There is a parking fee of $8 (Please carry a pen for self registration)
<br><br>
11. Bayshore trail (5.3 mile)
<br>
<br>
12. [Tiburon Waterfront](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tiburon-waterfront)

<br>
<br>
13. [Hazelnut Trail and Weiler Ranch Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/hazelnut-trail-and-weiler-ranch-loop?ref=result-card)
<br> 4.7 mile moderate hike, partially shaded. Didnâ€™t encounter a lot of people on the trail. Also it was one way. The park gate closes at sunset, so you could park outside on the street. There was a warning of mountain lion at the trailhead.
<br>
<br>
14. [Saddle Loop Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/saddle-loop-trail)
<br>3 miles easy trail,partly shaded. Stunning around sunset! Gorgeous views of the SF skyline and the bay!

<br>6 miles easy walk. Not much crowded on a weekday, a lot of bikers though. Awesome views of San Andreas Lake.
<br>
<br>
16. Mori Point trail (Easy 3 miles heavily trafficked
<br>
<br>
17. Sweeny ridge ( 5miles roundtrip easy) very beautiful
<br>
<br>
18. [Cogswell Marsh Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/cogswell-marsh-hayward-regional-shoreline)
<br>6 mile easy walk, do it around sunset! It's absolutely stunning!!
 We started from San Mateo bridge trailhead(instead trailhead at 37.64686260437708, -122.14515486561974). It was much easier to find parking there.
<br>
<br>
19. [SF Bay Trail: Roberts Landing to Marina Park](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/sf-bay-trail-roberts-landing-to-marina-park)
<br>6.6 miles easy walk by the bay, no shade. Superawesome at sunset. Marina Park was super crowded.
<br>
<br>
20. [SF Bay Trail: Interpretive Center to Hayward Landing](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/sf-bay-trail-interpretive-center-to-hayward-landing)
<br>9.2 mile easy walk by the bay, super super amazing at sunset.
<br>
<br>
21. [Clarkia, Sunset, Live Oak and Serpentine Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/clarkia-sunset-live-oak-and-serpentine-loop)
<br> 3 mile roundtrip, no special views, just if you want nature walk without the crowds. There is no designated parking, but you can park by the side of the road.
<br>
<br>
24. Baquiano trail (3.4 miles roundtrip, moderate)
<br>
<br>
25. Seaborg and Mariposa loop trail (Moderately hard - 7.5 miles, vies of mt diablo)
<br>
<br>
26. Philosophers way (2.5 miles)
<br>
<br>
27. [Lake Chabot: West Shore, Bass Cove, Columbine, Honker Bay, East Shore Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/lake-chabot-west-shore-bass-cove-columbine-honker-bay-east-shore-loop)
<br>9.3ish mile trail around the lake. Most of the section is paved and broad making it easier to maintain social distancing. Since it is a heavily trafficked trail, we did it on a weekday and it wasn't crowded.
<br>
<br>
28. [Cooley Landing Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/cooley-landing-trail)
<br> 3.2 mile easy walk, no shade. Next to Palo Alto airport and golf course. Do it around sunset.
<br>
<br>
29. [Point Lobos Loop Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/point-lobos-loop-trail)
<br>6.7 miles easy, very beautiful, specially the pelican area. Since this is a loop, you can start from anywhere, there are multiple parking lots. A very small section of the trail was closed for restoration.
<br>
<br>
30. [King Canyon Loop Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/kings-canyon-loop-trail)
<br>Alltrails shows 6.4 miles, but I recorded 7.32 miles on alltrails and 7.1 on my watch, so I am not sure how much it would be, but definitely more than 6.4
<br>It was quite empty considering we did it on Sunday afternoon, it was overcast that day. So probably clouds and cold was the reason we came across very few people.
<br>
<br>
31. [White Hill Fire Road](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/white-hill-fire-road)
<br>It was around 7.5 miles, alltrails shows 6.5, easy hike not crowded at all. Very few parking spaces available. Around 1 mile from the trailhead take the porcupine trail where it connects with White hill fire road. The alltrails suggested route is closed. Porcupine trail joins the white hill fire road ahead after about .3miles.

<br>
32. [Tennessee Valley Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tennessee-valley-trail?ref=result-card)
<br> 3.6 mile easy walk, almost no shade. Super heavily trafficked. Initially we had planned for another trail that day but I guess we got late to reach the trailhead and were turned away by the park ranger. So we did Tennessee Valley on a Saturaday evening. Although the beach was very beautiful at sunset, it was very crowded. We intend to go there again after the pandemic. But if you couldplease avoid this one for the time being.
<br>
<br>
33. [San Francisco Bay Trail Loop San Leandro](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/san-francisco-bay-trail-loop--3)
<br> 3 mile easy walk, no shade, lightly trafficked. Views are no doubt amazing but there is always some horrible smell at the trailhead, probably because of the Waste Management plant nearby. But the good thing is as you get past the trailhead, the smell disappears. There is some construction going on as well. Good sunset point.
<br>
<br>
34. [Almaden Quicksilver McAbee Mine Trail New Almaden Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/almaden-quicksilver-mcabee-mine-trail-new-almaden-trail)
<br>9.5 miles easy trail, unfortunately most of the people were not wearing masks. Also there was a warning of mountain lion at the trailhead. Usually it is heavily trafficked so we did it on a weekday. There were many people on the trails not wearing masks or making any effort to distance, specially the runners.
<br>
<br>
35. [East Shore, Ridgeline, East Ridge Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/east-shore-ridgeline-east-ridge-loop)
<br>5.3 mile easy hike, beautiful views of Lake Del Valle, lightly trafficked, almost no shade. It was so quiet and peaceful!
<br>

<br>
36. [Los Trancos Trail Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/los-trancos-trail-loop)
<br>7.7 miles easy hike, great for forest bathing. I just loved it, the smell of the tress after the rains, it was heavenly. Pretty gradual elevation gain. The best thing was it was one way due to Covid making it pretty safe to hike and without worrying about crossing anyone.
<br>
<br>
37. [Alta Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/alta-trail--2?ref=result-card)
<br>4.9 miles very easy trail, great views of Sausalito, Bay and the Ocean. Do it around sunset.
<br>
<br>
38. [Ring Mountain Fire Road](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/ring-mountain-fire-road)
<br>4.7 miles, No Shade. Alltrails incorrectly shows 4.1miles, also it is more than 800ft in elevation gain not 669ft as stated on alltrails. Amazing views of city and bay! The only downside is there is no parking at the trailhead, so you need to park somewhere down the street.
<br>
<br>
39. [Castle Rocks Lower Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/castle-rocks-lower-loop)
<br>Very beautiful trail but heavily trafficed, avoid absolutely on weekends.
<br>
<br>
40. [Bullhead Flat to Back Ranch Meadows Campground via Shoreline Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/bullhead-flat-to-back-ranch-meadows-campground-via-shoreline-trail?ref=result-card)
<br>8.2 mile easy out & back hike. Awesome views of the bay. There is a $3 fee for hikers/runner and $5 for car park. Although there is limited parking at the vistor station but there are plently od spot on the side of the road. Mainly this trail is used by the bikers and sadly most of them were not wearing masks. Since the trails is narrow, we ended up stepping off the trail quite a bit( I mean really every 10 steps) to make room for these unmasked bikers.
<br>
<br>
41. [Newark Slough Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/don-edwards-san-francisco-bay-national-wildlife-refuge-newark-slough-trail)
<br>6.5 miles easy trail, these days a little over 6.7, since theuy have closed the road before the bridge. Though itâ€™s moderately traffcked, but we didnâ€™t come across even a single person on the trail. There were people at the trailhead and some around the hill, I was surprised to find it empty for a Saturday afternoon. Probably other hikes/walks in the area are more popular. Great trail to do during covid.
<br>
<br>
42. [Nimitz Way Trail to Inspiration Peak and Jewel Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/nimitz-way-trail-to-inspiration-peak-and-jewel-lake)
<br>6 miles, easy hike. It was great, even though we started on late Sunday afternoon, it was heavily trafficked. If possible avoid it on weekends.
<br>
<br>
10. Dipsea to Muir Woods and back sunset
<br>
<br>
9. Black Sands Beach via Julian Trail
<br>
<br>

Ecology trail presidio (2 mile)
