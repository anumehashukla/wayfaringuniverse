We have lived in San Francisco for five years now but never got a chance to explore many of the hiking trails in the area due to our extensive travels, aside from a handful of the most popular ones. When the pandemic started, I remember how we would go to our secret spot on the Coastal Fire Road to smell the trees. Then in June, I finally decided to find some unpopular hikes(so that we don't come across many people) in the bay area :) For some forest bathing and to stay active. Since then, we have completed 44 hikes and over 50 walks to the hidden gem of Oyster Point. We've had many exciting experiences on these hikes, including seeing a lot of wildlife, such as snakes on at least six different trails, cute bunnies, coyotes, and a lot of elk. One of the best things about these hikes is that we got to see the downtowns of many Bay Area towns, such as Tiburon, San Anselmo, Livermore, Fairfax, Hayward, Corte Madera, Saratoga, Felton, and Moraga, for the first time.<br><br>

<b>*While hiking these trails, I made several observations that might be helpful for anyone interested in exploring them:*</b>
<br><br>
* Although some of these hikes may not be visually striking, we purposely timed 90% of them to coincide with sunset, which greatly enhanced the overall ambiance. The breathtaking sunsets and delicate pink hues created an indescribable atmosphere. Our primary objective was to stay active and immerse ourselves in nature.
<br>
<br>
* I usually opted for hikes that had moderate to light foot traffic, avoiding heavily crowded ones unless we visited on weekdays.
<br>
<br>
* Regarding the debate of hiking in the morning versus the afternoon, I discovered that afternoons offered better chances of finding parking spots. I had always believed that mornings were the optimal time for hiking, but it turns out I was mistaken. Afternoons meant fewer crowds and readily available parking.
<br>
<br>
* Longer hikes mean fewer people. We noticed that longer hikes tended to have fewer people. Even when the parking lots were full, we rarely encountered more than ten individuals on such trails. We appreciated the tranquility and solitude of these hikes.
<br>
<br>
* To locate and keep track of the hikes, I relied on AllTrails. I observed that around 99% of the hikes were actually 0.3 to 0.5 miles longer than what was initially stated on the AllTrails app. The free version of the app proved to be quite useful for navigating through all of these trails.
<br>


If you're seeking outdoor activities to stay active, I've gathered a collection of excellent options for you. Below is a comprehensive list of our hikes, complete with pertinent information and links to their respective AllTrails pages. All the trails mentioned in this list are either out-and-back or loop trails, except for the Dipsea Trail, which is a point-to-point trail, meaning it doesn't conclude at the same starting point.
<br><br>
*Happy Trails!*

# Easy Trails
{: id="easyTrails"}
<br>

1. [Sweeney Ridge ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/sweeney-ridge--2?ref=result-card)*- 5 mile, Elev Gain 750 ft*
<br>It is one of my favorites in the bay area. This trail is easy and paved but lacks shade. Situated between San Bruno and Pacifica, Sweeney Ridge consists of hilly terrain with several ridges. Notably, this ridge holds historical significance as the San Francisco Bay Discovery Site, marking the first sighting of San Francisco Bay by the Portol√° expedition. As you reach the ridge, you'll come across abandoned buildings that were once part of the SF-51C Nike missile control defense system.<br>
The highlight of this hike was witnessing the captivating sight of fog rolling in as we approached the ridge. It created a breathtaking atmosphere, particularly during sunset. I highly recommend setting out on this hike around sunset when there is fog, as it provides the most remarkable experience. Views of the bay on one side and the ocean on the other, what more could you ask for? The sunset viewed from Sweeney Ridge remains one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, Free<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> No<br>

2. [Mount Tamalpais Middle Peak Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/mount-tamalpais-middle-peak-loop-trail)*- 5.9 miles Elev Gain 950 ft*
<br>The views at the top of the trail are absolutely gorgeous! 360 degrees breathtaking panoramic views. We found out that the actual distance is around 5.9ish miles, although AllTrails may show it as 5.3 miles. The trail provides ample shade, which is perfect for hot summer months. You'll encounter diverse terrain, including lush forests with pine trees, redwoods, and oaks, as well as rocky sections and uneven terrain. It's highly recommended to wear hiking shoes or boots, as the trail remains rocky throughout. Apart from a few steep sections, the trail is generally easy to navigate. With fewer people on the trail, it offers a peaceful and uncrowded experience. Keep in mind that there is an $8 parking fee, so make sure to bring some cash.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, self-registration $8 per vehicle, carry cash & pen<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available<br>

<br>
3. [Dias Ridge Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/dias-ridge-trail--3)*- 6 miles Elev Gain 1100 ft*
<br>Certain sections of the trail can be narrow, requiring caution and awareness. Unfortunately, during my hike, I almost got hit by a cyclist head-on who was traveling at high speed, disregarding the fact that the trail is meant for hikers as well. This was the first time something like this happened after hiking in Bay Area for several years. It is essential for all trail users, including cyclists, to respect the shared use and adhere to trail rules, ensuring the safety and enjoyment of everyone on the trail.
The trail is well-marked and overgrown in some sections, but overall pretty maintained. It winds through rolling hills covered in vibrant wildflowers during the spring and summer months. The highlight of the Dias Ridge Trail is undoubtedly the breathtaking views it offers. As you hike along the ridge, you'll be treated to sweeping vistas of the Pacific Ocean, the San Francisco Bay, and the surrounding Marin County landscape.<br><br>

<br>A comfortable 6-mile stroll that's not overly busy on weekdays, although you'll encounter a significant number of bikers. The views of San Andreas Lake are nice. This trail is closed due to storm damage as of June 2023. I'll update it if and when it reopens.<br><br>

<br>Easy out-and-back hike with some great views of San Pablo Bay. The trail winds through a dry landscape, nestled within an evergreen forest and oak woodland. As you explore, you'll encounter a variety of majestic trees, including coast live oak, California black oak, manzanita, and madrone. We had the pleasure of spotting numerous deer and squirrels along the way. The visitor station has limited parking, but you can find ample space along the side of the road. While this trail is primarily used by bikers, we found ourselves frequently stepping off the trail to accommodate them, roughly every ten steps. As you traverse the path, you'll encounter partial shade, but if you go after 4:00 pm, you'll find yourself mostly shielded from the sun as the hills in the west obstruct it.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, $3 for hikers/runners & $5 for carpark<br>

<br>The trail is a breeze to hike, and it offers a joyful experience, especially during sunset. The stunning vistas of the San Francisco skyline and the bay are simply breathtaking.<br><br>

<br>The trail around the lake spans more than 9 miles. The majority of the route is paved and wide, generally well-maintained and clean. It is relatively easy with gradual inclines, suitable for occasional hikers. Most of the route offers views of the lake. To avoid crowds, we opted to hike it on a weekday, which proved to be less busy. Also, it's very hard to find parking on weekends.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available - Park at the Lake Chabot Marina, $5 per vehicle<br>

<br>
8. [Fort Funston Coastal Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/fort-funston-coastal-trail)*- 2 mile, Elev Gain 160 ft*
<br>Enjoy breathtaking coastal views on an effortless stroll along the coast.  Whether it's immersed in ethereal fog or bathed in radiant sunlight, Fort Funston's beauty transcends weather conditions. We had the opportunity to experience both scenarios, and each day was equally enchanting. Keep in mind that it's typically windy at the location, adding to the unique atmosphere. Also note that the trail consists of a mix of paved sections and sandy terrain, so it's advisable to wear suitable footwear if you wish to keep your shoes clean. The route provided by AllTrails leads to a small two-car parking lot, but there's a larger parking area near the observation deck. On the map, I've designated the larger lot as the trailhead. The park gate closes one hour past sunset, and you'll find portable toilets available at the trailhead. Fort Funston isn't just renowned for its magnificent vistas; it's also a popular hub for hang-gliding enthusiasts. A must-do!<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, Free<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available, Portable toilets<br>

<br> Beautiful coastal views, with a variety of wildflowers, adding bursts of color to the landscape. It can be quite windy, especially by the ocean, so it's advisable to bring appropriate clothing. The trail conditions can be slippery in certain areas, so wearing sturdy shoes is recommended. Due to its popularity, Mori Point can get crowded, so doing it on a weekday is a good idea to secure parking and enjoy a more serene experience. On foggy days, the mist adds a mystical touch to the surroundings. Overall a must-visit. <br><br>

<br>Located just a few miles south of Carmel-by-the-Sea and a short drive from San Francisco or Big Sur, this trail offers visitors a chance to immerse themselves in stunning natural beauty. The diverse range of environments, from vibrant Monterey pine and Cypress groves to picturesque coastal shrub-covered cliffs, provide sweeping ocean vistas. Keep an eye out, as this area is teeming with wildlife. We saw harbor seals, otters, and sea lions, plus tons of Pelicans. The Point Lobos State Natural Reserve has a well-maintained network of hiking trails. As a loop trail, you have the flexibility to begin your journey from any point, with multiple parking lots available for your convenience.<br><br>

<br>Wildcat Peak offers a truly phenomenal view that is sure to leave you breathless. From the peak, you can enjoy panoramic vistas of the entire East Bay, San Francisco, Marin, and the Golden Gate Bridge, extending all the way up north. However, reaching the summit via Nimitz Way may not be the most enjoyable part of the hike, as it follows a paved road throughout. Nonetheless, once you veer off onto the hiking trail just before Peace Grove, the experience becomes much more pleasant. Despite starting the hike on a Sunday evening, the trail was heavily trafficked, so if you have the flexibility, avoid visiting on weekends. the trail's actual distance measured approximately 6.3 miles, which is slightly longer.<br><br>

<br>It is a highly sought-after destination for hiking and running enthusiasts. It was no surprise that we encountered tons of people along the way. The highlight of the trip was reaching Inspiration Point, which offered a pleasant view. However, I must admit that I've seen trails with even more breathtaking vistas. Despite this, the overall experience of exploring the area was worthwhile. If you're looking for a popular spot for hiking and running, this area is a great choice, but if you're seeking the absolute best views, you might want to consider exploring other trails nearby.<br><br>

It combines existing park paths with fourteen "musing stations" that highlight the area's ecology, geography, and history. These are a point to pause and reflect on mind, body, and soul in conjunction with the natural surrounding. We hiked it at sunrise, and it was an amazing experience, blending the beauty of nature with moments of reflection. Highly recommended for those seeking inspiration and connection with the surroundings.<br><br>

<br> Instead of beginning our journey from the Sharp Park Road trailhead, we opted to start from the Connemara Drive parking lot. ([Refer the map for the Connemara Drive trailhead](#trailheadsMap){: .js-no-ajax}  ) Please note that parking availability is limited at both trailheads. As we embarked on our hike, we were immediately rewarded with stunning views of the ocean and Pacifica, especially as the sun began to set. The scenery was truly picturesque, and we couldn't help but feel awe-inspired by the sweeping vistas. A couple of steep sections, but overall it is an easy hike. With only 4-5 individuals crossing our path, we relished the tranquility and solitude that the trail offered.<br><br>

The best part is that it forms a loop, allowing you to begin your hike from any point you prefer. Along the trail, you'll find three convenient parking lots; do keep in mind that there is an $8 parking fee. We did this trail on a sunny Sunday afternoon, we were initially concerned about the anticipated crowds.

Depending on where you want to start, there are three different parking selections available.

<br>The Oak Ridge Trail takes you through lush oak woodlands, providing a shaded and peaceful environment. The oak trees create a canopy which makes the trail mostly shadedand well suited for a sunny day. It's an easy well maintained trail, although a lot of bikers. Keep in mind park users who use the trails at the park but have not paid for day-use parking are required to pay day-use trail fees of $3.00 per person.<br><br>

<br>Easy, partially shaded trail in Waterdog Lake & Open Space, Belmont offers a few steep sections with beautiful views of the lake and bay. However, there is no parking lot or restrooms at the trailhead, and parking must be done on the street. The last mile of the trail takes you through residential streets.

31. [Tarwater Trail Loopl Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tarwater-trail-loop)*- 5 mile, Elev Gain 750 ft*
<br>The trailhead parking is situated along a narrow, winding road, and the last mile can be challenging with potholes. As you begin the hike, the initial first mile descends under the sun, while the rest of the hike provides abundant shade, rendering it a superb option for a warm day.
The forest, dominated by coast redwood ferns and other shade-loving plants thrive in the lower elevations.
We did it on a Sunday afternoon, and encountered minimal crowds, crossing paths with only three other people. Recent rainfall resulted in muddy sections along the trail but despite the mud, the hike was so pretty especially the redwood grove. One notable aspect we appreciated was the extraordinary silence, as not even a hint of wind disturbed the tranquility. The scent of the surroundings was particularly pleasant due to the recent rains.<br>
We thoroughly enjoyed this hike and plan to do it again. It provided a serene and beautiful escape, with the redwood grove standing out as a highlight.<br>
**Important Note:** A fellow hiker we met at the trailhead shared a cautionary tale about ticks on her dog. It's advisable to be cautious and aware of ticks in the area during your hike.<br><br>

<br>Old Railroad Grade Fire Road in Mill Valley is a fantastic hiking spot. The trail is suitable for various skill levels, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced hikers. It follows an old railroad route, perfect for a leisurely escape into nature. The path is well-maintained, with a gradual incline that makes it accessible for beginners. The packed dirt trail is easy on the knees, and there are shaded areas to cool off on warmer days. It wasn't busy; we only encountered a few bikers during our visit.<br>
Parked alongside Fern Canyon Road, where parking is limited to only 2 to 3 cars. Alternatively, you can park at the trail's end on W Blithedale Ave.<br><br>

<br>Keep in mind that the section leading directly to the Point Bonita lighthouse is accessible only during limited hours each week. We hiked around sunrise, and the lighthouse was closed. So the trail is 3.62 miles long, and if the lighthouse is closed. However, if the lighthouse is open, the total distance increases to 4.4 miles. Nevertheless, it was the best sunrise we saw in the Bay Area, offering gorgeous views of the ocean, Golden Gate Bridge, and the city. It was truly breathtaking. Started the hike at 6:30 am, and to my surprise, the parking lot was completely empty‚Äîno cars at all, especially unexpected for a weekend.
Descending back to the beach was tricky, some sketchy sections, might pose challenges with stability concerns, hiking poles could be useful.<br>
Excellent trail‚Äîhighly recommend catching the sunrise.<br><br>

<br>If you're seeking some fresh air outdoors and peaceful time, this is the perfect choice. The trail is relatively uneventful, with no breathtaking views. It mainly traverses through a valley and a small section of the forest. This trail is not heavily trafficked, so finding parking was easy. There were hardly any people on this trail.

<br>This hike is adorned with trees and the soothing melody of a creek. The well-shaded path provides minimal washout, picturesque spots for photography, and an overall peaceful ambiance. A worthwhile journey for those seeking diverse nature experiences.<br>

<br>This is a easy trail in Orinda, and most of it was nicely shaded, making it a comfortable walk. I went on a Saturday evening, and finding parking was a breeze. While the hike was great overall, there were a few spots that were flooded, so be prepared for that. However, it didn't spoil the fun, and the rest of the trail made up for it with beautiful scenery. It's fascinating to learn that Round Top is made up of lava and volcanic debris from a volcano that existed around 10 million years ago. If you're interested in learning more about the geological features of the park, the park website offers a fantastic self-guided tour. The tour covers information about the vista points and details about Sibley Volcanic. You can find it *[here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3e80aa360f98479b92ac4264af0aa04a).*<br><br>

<br>This trail in Redwood Reinhardt Regional Park is a fantastic hiking trail, especially if you enjoy forest hikes like I do. It's like finding a hidden gem right in the heart of the city! But one downside is that it can get quite heavily trafficked. Due to its convenient urban location, the trail attracts many visitors, especially during peak times. The trail takes you through an amazing forest with towering redwood trees, the lush green surroundings and the refreshing air make it a perfect place to connect with nature. The loop offers a good mix of terrain, and the well-maintained trail ensures a pleasant hiking experience. If you're looking for a rejuvenating walk in a beautiful forest within an urban setting, this trail is definitely worth exploring.<br><br>

38. [Skyline Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/skyline-trail--3)*- 6.6 miles, Elev Gain 800 ft*
<br>The trail, labeled as having a 1330 ft elevation gain, was a bit misleading as it turned out to be around 800 ft. Despite this hiccup, the well-maintained path proved to be an easy trek, contradicting the moderate difficulty assigned to it on Alltrails. The trail leads you into a peaceful forest, predominantly flat with occasional gentle ups and downs. One noticeable drawback is the proximity to Hwy 35, resulting in intermittent traffic noise along certain parts of the trail. This can be a bit distracting for those seeking complete serenity. It's an ideal setting for forest bathing, lush greenery and the soothing shade provided by the towering oak and redwood trees allowing everyone to immerse themselves in the calming ambiance of nature.<br>

<br>It was super amazing at sunrise. I chose to explore this trail at sunrise in February, when the hills in the Bay Area are lush green due to the January rains. The scenery was absolutely stunning, with the vibrant greenery of the rolling hills creating a picturesque backdrop. This trail is more like a walk than a strenuous hike, making it accessible for various fitness levels. It's important to note that there is minimal shade along the trail, so it's advisable to plan accordingly. Wearing sunscreen, a hat, and bringing plenty of water is essential, especially during warmer months.<br><br>

1. [Tomales Point Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tomales-point-trail)*- 9.7 mile, Elev Gain 1200 ft*
<br>This is one of the best hikes we did in the bay area. The trail is approximately 10 miles long; it is pleasant and easy. Suitable for various levels of hikers. It offers magnificent views of the coastline and ocean. Lots of wildlife as well - from majestic elk and deer to lively coyotes, quail, seals, birds, and rabbits; the trail offers an incredible opportunity to witness the wonders of wildlife up close. A thrilling encounter with a snake and one of the most breathtaking sunsets we've ever seen. Keep in mind there is no shade, so come prepared with sun protection. Some overgrown sections on the trail; otherwise, the conditions as great. Highly recommended!<br><br>

2. [Rodeo Valley Loop and Slacker Hill ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/rodeo-valley-loop-and-slacker-hill)*- 6.2 miles, Elev Gain 1112 ft*
<br> The trail offers stunning scenic views of the city and the Golden Gate Bridge. It is a moderate trail with a gradual elevation gain. Black Sands Beach via Julian Trail and this trail share the same trailhead. Since it's a loop, you also have the flexibility to start from other trailheads. Despite having lived in the Bay Area for five years, I hadn't visited Slacker Hill until 2020, which I admit was embarrassing :). However, the viewpoint there is absolutely amazing, providing breathtaking vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge, city, ocean, and bay. It's a must-do experience, although it's advisable to avoid weekends due to potential crowds. If you plan to hike on a sunny day, it's essential to bring enough water and sunscreen, as there's minimal shade along the entire trail. For truly memorable moments, I recommend doing the hike during sunrise or sunset, as both offer spectacular views from this trail.<br><br>

3. [Almaden Quicksilver McAbee Mine Trail New Almaden Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/almaden-quicksilver-mcabee-mine-trail-new-almaden-trail) *- 13.5 miles, Elev Gain 2300 ft*
<br>The trail route has undergone changes since our hike in 2020. When we did it, the trail measured around 9.8 miles with an elevation gain of 1700 feet. The trailhead used to be located at the end of McAbee Rd, and some people still follow the old route (if you want to check out the old route, visit the activities section on AllTrails and search for activities dated before 2021). However, there is now a new trailhead that has a restroom and a parking lot, which is a welcome improvement. During our hike, parking was limited, requiring us to park off the street, and there were no restroom facilities available.<br>
Regardless of the route you choose, it's advisable to avoid weekends due to the heavy trail traffic. We opted for a weekday hike, and it turned out to be perfect in terms of crowd levels. Additionally, I recommend selecting an overcast day for the hike, as the sun can be quite intense on a long hike like this. It's best to steer clear of hot summer days.
While on the trail, we enjoyed nice views and got a good workout. It's worth noting that there was a mountain lion warning at the trailhead, so it's essential to remain vigilant. <br><br>

<br>The trail presents awe-inspiring vistas that encompass San Francisco, Rodeo Beach, Tennessee Valley, the vast ocean, and the surrounding landscape. It has several steep but not too bad. It also has an intriguing point of interest: the abandoned Nike missile site. Sharing the same trailhead as the Tennessee Valley trail, this route sees less foot traffic on weekdays, although the parking lot can still fill up. It appears that most visitors are drawn to Tennessee Beach and other hikes originating from this trailhead. However, during our hike, we encountered only a few fellow hikers, providing a more secluded experience. It's important to note that the trail offers no shade, so it's advisable to bring ample water and sunscreen for sun protection. For a less crowded weekday hike, this trail comes highly recommended.<br><br>

<br>Instead of beginning at the Muir Woods parking lot, we opted to start our hike from the Pantoll Campground. This alternative route added approximately half a mile and 200 feet of elevation to the trail. However, the convenience of starting from Pantoll was unbeatable as it didn't require a Muir Woods Parking Permit for hiking. The scenery was absolutely breathtaking, especially because we went on this hike after a bout of rainfall. The creeks were brimming with water, forming charming little waterfalls along the way. The forest floor was adorned with vibrant ferns and delicate wildflowers, painting a picture-perfect scene of natural beauty. A must-do!<br><br>

<br>This moderately challenging trail is an excellent choice for anyone seeking an invigorating workout amidst beautiful natural surroundings. The trail spans a good distance and offers a mix of inclines that really get your heart pumping and your calves burning, but the rewarding views make every step worthwhile. Interestingly, we didn't come across any fellow hikers on the trail except for a few individuals in the parking lot. The solitude provided a tranquil and serene experience as if we had the entire trail to ourselves. We did it around sunset, and the enchanting pink hues of the sky, complemented by the magnificent backdrop of Mt. Diablo, created a truly remarkable scene.<br><br>

<br>According to AllTrails, the trail measures 6.4 miles; however, my own tracking showed 7.32 miles on AllTrails and 7.1 miles on my watch, suggesting that the actual distance is likely longer than the listed 6.4 miles. Surprisingly, despite doing it on a Sunday afternoon, the trail was not crowded. The overcast and chilly weather conditions in November might have contributed to the fewer hikers we encountered. It's a pretty hike, with nice views of the reservoir and the surrounding area. It's quite tranquil, likely due to the absence of large crowds. However, be cautious of sun exposure if you end up going on a sunny day.<br><br>

<br> This hike is moderately challenging and has partial shade along the way. It's not particularly challenging, but it's enough to get your heart rate up and work up a light sweat. The first half involves a decent uphill section followed by a downhill stretch in the second half. You'll pass through a beautiful eucalyptus grove, and you'll find a lot of bunnies along the trail. It's important to note that the park gate closes at sunset, but street parking is available outside. Please be cautious, as there is a warning of mountain lion sightings at the trailhead.<br><br>

11. [Castle Rocks Lower Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/castle-rocks-lower-loop)*- 6.5 mile, Elev Gain 1200 ft*
<br> The trail, spanning a distance of 6.5 miles, is remarkable in its beauty and quality. However, it tends to attract a significant amount of foot traffic until it intersects with the Interconnector Trail. This popularity often leads to heavy congestion. When we did it, it came to a complete halt for approximately 15 minutes, with a queue of at least 30 people forming. Surprisingly, beyond that juncture, the trail becomes devoid of any human presence. It appears that most individuals opt for alternative trails, which is why I would recommend avoiding this particular route on weekends. Some scrambling skills are required around boulders. Cable rails have been installed along certain sections to help hikers. It's worth noting that the last two miles of the trail are accompanied by the somewhat bothersome background noise from a nearby gun range. Nonetheless, the hike itself is truly exceptional, especially when accompanied by excellent weather. The views along the Saratoga Gap trail are nothing short of breathtaking.<br><br>

12. [White Hill Fire Road ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/white-hill-fire-road)*- 7.5 mile, Elev Gain 1300 ft*
<br>The distance was approximately 7.5 miles, but AllTrails displays an incorrect measurement of 6.5 miles, which is significantly off. The hike is of moderate difficulty and surprisingly not crowded. However, there are only a few parking spaces available. Good mix of forest & open areas. Once you're about a mile from the trailhead, you'll need to take the Porcupine Trail, which connects with the White Hill Fire Road. Unfortunately, the suggested route on AllTrails is closed. Instead, the Porcupine Trail merges with the White Hill Fire Road approximately 0.3 miles ahead. It could become really hot on a sunny day. Nevertheless, with proper planning(enough water & sun protection) and timing, this hike could be enjoyable<br><br>

<br>I give this trail only two stars solely for its breathtaking panoramic views. However, I must point out that the trail's length is not accurately stated as 6.7 miles; it is actually more than 7.4 miles with an elevation gain of 1380 ft. Moreover, the downhill sections of the trail were incredibly challenging and unpleasant. I highly advise wearing hiking shoes to navigate the trail safely. In addition to the aforementioned concerns, another issue with the trail was the unreliable mapping on AllTrails, which often deviated from the actual route. Furthermore, there were, so many bifurcations that you are most of the time on phone figuring out which way to go. It's important to note that this trail is primarily designed for biking and may not be ideal for hiking.<br><br>

15. [Tennessee Valley to Alta Ridge Loop ](hhttps://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tennessee-valley-to-alta-ridge-loop?search=true)*- 5.5 mile, Elev gain 1168 ft*
<br>This hiking trail that offers a perfect blend of coastal beauty and scenic landscapes. This trail that begins a mile before the Tennessee Valley Trailhead.
Setting off from the designated starting point, just before the Tennessee Valley Trailhead, the trail immediately immerses you in a world of lush greenery and captivating scenery. The initial stretch showcases a picturesque valley adorned with wildflowers and tall grasses.
A significant highlight of this hike is the point where the trail intersects with the Alta Trail, leading you to the ridge line. While the ascent presents a moderate challenge, the rewards are unparalleled. Reaching the top unveils a stunning vista encompassing the Golden Gate Bridge, the iconic San Francisco skyline, and the vast expanse of the ocean. This vantage point is a perfect spot to rest, reflect, and appreciate the wonders of nature. Furthermore, the section which connects Alta Trail intersects with Miwok Trail presents some concerns, as it features precarious footing due to loose rocks and a steep incline.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, park off Tennessee Valley Rd, alternatively you can park at Tennessee Valley Trailhead Parking Lot, and start the hike from there.<br>

<br>The trail crosses the beautiful Tafoni formations.*(The structures covering the sandstone are called Tafoni, which is Italian for the cavern. Thousands of years of complex weathering processes created the caves, columns, and sandy surfaces that are smooth in some areas and covered with labyrinths of knobs and ridges in others.)* There are a few sections on this trail that are quite steep, and one section in particular that is super super steep. It is highly recommended to follow the clockwise route as suggested by AllTrails, as attempting to descend the super steep section without hiking poles would be extremely challenging. It is well marked and maintained! Good for forest bathing.<br><br>

<br>Nice hike! There were a few steep sections that required caution, especially when descending. It is highly recommended to wear appropriate footwear, such as hiking shoes, to ensure stability. The trailhead on Highway 1 has limited parking, accommodating only around six cars. Alternatively, parking at Montara State Beach, which is a short distance of 0.2 miles from the trailhead, is a viable option. It's worth noting that the distance reported on AllTrails is inaccurate, as the hike measured approximately 5.8 miles when done counterclockwise. This route can be considered moderately difficult in that direction. Our choice to hike on a weekday evening offered the delightful bonus of witnessing a stunning sunset over the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>

18. [High Ridge Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/high-ridge-loop-trail)*- 5.8 mile, Elev Gain 1,223 ft*
<br>There are countless scenic views to behold along this trail.  As you reach higher elevations, you'll be rewarded with sweeping vistas of the entire Bay Area. These breathtaking views serve as a reminder of the beauty of the Bay Area and add an extra touch of magic to the hiking experience. The trail is well-maintained, with clearly defined paths and occasional benches for hikers to rest and take in the surroundings. We did it on an overcast day and it was gorgeous. While AllTrails may classify it as a hard trail, in my opinion, it falls more into the moderate difficulty range. It's important to mention that there is no shade and it is totally exposed to the sun.
With proper planning (plenty of water and sunscreen) and timing, this hike could be easily done. A must-do!<br><br>

19. [Slate Creek Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/slate-creek-loop)*- 5.4 miles, Elev Gain 1043 ft*
<br>One of the most striking aspects of the Slate Creek Loop Trail is the dense redwood forest that envelops you from the moment you set foot on the trail. Towering trees create a serene and tranquil atmosphere, providing a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The shade offered by these ancient giants makes it an ideal hike even on hot summer days. As you make your way along the trail, you'll encounter several picturesque spots that are perfect for pausing and soaking in the natural beauty. These include scenic viewpoints, moss-covered bridges, and even the remnants of an old homestead, adding a touch of history to the hike. The diversity of flora and fauna along the trail is impressive, providing ample opportunities for nature enthusiasts and photographers to capture breathtaking moments. No/Poor cell reception within the park and the surrounding area, so I would advise to download offline maps before hitting the trail. A must-do!<br><br>

<br>The climb is a steady incline. It was astonishing to begin our journey around 8:00 am on a Sunday and encounter only a handful of individuals along the trail. The scenery is absolutely stunning as it has both the bay and the ocean. I highly suggest undertaking this hike; however, keep in mind that the sun can become intense as the day progresses, so it's advisable to schedule your hike for either early morning or late afternoon.<br><br>

<br>The trail begins at Rodeo Beach, which is a stunning expanse of golden sand bordered by rugged cliffs. The views of the Pacific Ocean are simply breathtaking, with crashing waves and a refreshing sea breeze. The beach is a great spot for picnicking, sunbathing, or even some beachcombing. The trail itself is well-maintained and moderately challenging, making it accessible to hikers of various skill levels. There are also several lookout points along the way that provide panoramic vistas of the Marin Headlands, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the San Francisco skyline in the distance. There are a couple of steep climbs, but they are manageable. We did it on a Sunday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to find the trail relatively empty, despite the beach being swarmed with people. The parking lot is expansive, and finding a spot was a breeze.

<br> This Pacifica trail offers a mix of coastal beauty and diverse terrain. The paved sections, while not everyone's favorite, are balanced by stunning views and varying landscapes. Despite some drawbacks, like proximity to the highway, this trail offers great views. The starting point may be challenging to find, but the spectacular coastal views and inclines are worth the effort. The trail's entrance might be tricky to find, but once on the path, expect gorgeous coastal vistas, occasional encounters with poison oak, and the occasional foggy day. A must-do hike for Bay Area enthusiasts.<br><br>

<br>This trail, situated close to Moraga, offers a moderate experience with minimal shade. Featuring a couple of steep segments, I suggest doing it counterclockwise to avoid navigating a particularly steep downhill section in the final stretch. It is very steep, I recommend using hiking poles & shoes with good grip, in case you decide to do clockwise. Keep in mind that free parking is limited, accommodating only four cars. Alternatively you can park inside the park for $7.
<br>
**Note** - Sometime harmful algae present in Lafayette Reservoir, while activities near the water, such as picnicking, biking, and hiking, are safe. Take the following precautions for your safety - Body contact with water is never permitted. Keep children away from the water and the shoreline. Use tap water to rinse any skin that has contacted lake water. - Keep pets, especially dogs, out of the water. They should neither enter nor drink the water.

The well-defined trails and the lush expanse of the dense forest adds to the overall hiking experience. There are a few steep downhill sections on this trail, but the uphill portions are gradual, ensuring a manageable ascent. The trailhead has limited parking space, so if you plan to hike on weekends, it's advisable to begin in the afternoon to secure a spot. The trail is also popular among bikers.<br>

Ample signage and informational plaques provide insights into the historical significance of Fort Point and the surrounding areas.<br>
Keep in mind that the weather along the coast can be unpredictable, so it's advisable to dress in layers and be prepared for brisk winds. Additionally, weekends may attract more visitors, so planning a weekday visit can enhance the overall experience.<br>

<br>This trail is a great place for a hike along Skyline Boulevard. I suggest going on a cloudy day because most of the trail is out in the open. This way, it's not too hot, and you can enjoy the surroundings better. The ascend was gradual, it's a nice option for those who want a moderate outdoor activity without too much difficulty. The best part is when you reach the top of Borel Hill. Breathtaking panoramic views of the bay and everything around. When I went, fog started rolling in, making the scene even more special. The mist added a magical touch to the whole experience, making it really memorable. Just pick a day with some clouds, and you'll have a great time, especially if the fog decides to join in.

<br>The Valley View, Weiler Ranch, and Hazelnut Trail Loop at San Pedro Valley Park is definitely worth exploring. Gradual ascents and descents, nothing drastic, keep your heart pumping. What I love the most about this trail is that you pass through a grove of Eucalyptus trees; it smells heavenly. I have done this trail twice and would definitely go back again to enjoy that scent. The trailhead is easily accessible, with ample parking available. There are also informative signs along the way, providing interesting tidbits about the local flora and fauna.

1. [Berry Creek Falls Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/berry-creek-falls-trail)*- 12.5 mile, Elev Gain 2400 ft*
<br> This trail spans a distance of 13 miles, offering a moderately challenging terrain that provides ample shade along the way. It's an excellent choice for a workout hike but be prepared as it can be strenuous. Our completion time was 4 hours and 13 minutes, so ensure you have snacks and enough water to keep you fueled throughout the journey. It's advisable to carry a trail map with you as taking a wrong turn or detour could increase both the distance and time, further intensifying the hike. While the trail offers plenty of shade, it's important to note that it can still get quite hot during summer. Therefore, I strongly recommend bringing an ample water supply to stay hydrated throughout the hike. We had the opportunity to hike this trail before it was significantly affected by wildfires. Unfortunately, the trail had to be closed for an extended period due to the damage caused, but now it has reopened. Previously, it was a picturesque route, but now there have been reports of several burnt-down trees from a few individuals who have ventured through the area.<br><br>

2. [Fall Creek and Lost Empire Trail Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/fall-creek)*- 11.5 miles, Elev Gain 2200 ft*
<br>In my opinion, I found this trail to be more challenging compared to the Berry Creek Falls trail, despite being labeled as "moderate" on AllTrails. (Update: We completed this trail in June 2020 when it was categorized as moderate, but as of June 2023, it has been reclassified as hard. Additionally, the route we took back then was slightly different, strictly following AllTrails, spanning 11.5 miles. However, there is now a shorter route available, measuring 9.8 miles.) The segments where you walk alongside the stream amidst the magnificent redwoods during the first two and last two miles of the loop are truly awe-inspiring. The scenery is absolutely stunning. Once again, make sure to bring an ample supply of water and food, and don't forget to download an offline map.<br><br>

<br> It's a challenging hike with lots of elevation. The trail commences with a downhill stretch, followed by a relentless and arduous ascent towards the summit of Mt. Diablo. Be prepared for narrow passages at certain points along the way, adding an extra element of thrill. Opting to undertake the hike clockwise on a tranquil Sunday evening proved to be a wise choice, as we encountered few fellow hikers. Ample parking was conveniently accessible at the Diablo Valley Overlook. The vistas throughout the journey were absolutely splendid, treating us to breathtaking scenery. Fortunately, we reached the summit just in the nick of time to witness a truly magnificent sunset. This hike is an absolute must for outdoor enthusiasts in Bay Area!<br><br>

4. [Mitchell Canyon and Eagle Peak Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/eagle-peak-loop)*- 8.3 mile, Elev Gain 2,200 ft*
<br>The hike actually spans 8.3 miles, contrary to the incorrect measurement of 7.7 miles reported by AllTrails. It is moderately challenging with intermittent shade. We hiked in a counterclockwise direction, encountering a gradual ascent but facing a rather treacherous downhill section. The descent featured a couple of very steep segments and loose gravel, which made me regret not having hiking poles. It proved to be tough on the knees, and unfortunately, I even took a fall on the gravel portion. Fortunately, I escaped without any serious injury. Therefore, I strongly recommend hiking poles specifically for the descent. The initial 3 miles of the hike provided refreshing shade. We started our hike at approximately 4:00 pm and completed it in around 3 hours and 40 minutes. Encountering only a few individuals at the trailhead, we had the trail mostly to ourselves. Remember to bring a pen and some cash as self-registration is necessary for parking.<br><br>

4. [Cooley Landing Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/cooley-landing-trail)*- 3.2 mile*
<br> The walk is pleasant and ideal for unwinding after work. Also, fun to watch planes take off and land from Palo Alto Airport. Not too crowded on weekends. Sunsets will create a stunning backdrop for your evening stroll.<br><br>

5. [Tennessee Valley Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tennessee-valley-trail)*- 3.6 mile*
<br> The 3.6-mile walk at Tennessee Valley is relatively easy, but be prepared for limited shade along the trail. It's a beautiful trail that provides excellent hiking opportunities with the chance to encounter a diverse range of wildlife. During our hike, we spot a coyote. It's important to note that the trail tends to be heavily trafficked, especially on weekends. While the beach offers an incredible view during sunset, it can become overwhelmingly crowded.<br><br>

6. [Newark Slough Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/don-edwards-san-francisco-bay-national-wildlife-refuge-newark-slough-trail)*- 6.5 mile*
<br>The trail is a straightforward dirt path through the marshland, measuring just over 6.7 miles due to the recent road closure preceding the bridge. Despite its moderate level of traffic, we encountered not a single soul along the trail. Interestingly, there were individuals gathered at the trailhead and a few scattered around the hill, but to my surprise, the trail itself was deserted on a Saturday afternoon. It appears that other hikes and walks in the vicinity enjoy greater popularity. Nevertheless, it remains an excellent choice for an evening walk and birdwatching.<br><br>

<br>
7. [Limantour Beach Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/limantour-beach-trail)*- 5.4 mile*
<br> It's a beautiful walk along the beach. One of the notable aspects of this beach is its vast width and length, making it a perfect spot for much-needed peace and relaxation. However, I must admit that I'm not particularly fond of long walks on the sand. If you happen to enjoy walking on sand, I would definitely recommend it. As we ventured further from the parking lot, we found ourselves with the beach all to ourselves, which was truly wonderful. One thing worth mentioning is that it was quite windy during our visit. This might be something to keep in mind when planning your trip. Also, please note [Limantour Spit harbor seal pupping area ](https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/management/upload/lawsandpolicies_map_limantour_spit_hseal_closure.pdf)(which is just a tiny portion of the trail) is closed to all entry from March 1 to June 30 of each year.<br><br>

8. [SF Bay Trail and Oyster Bay Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/san-francisco-bay-trail-and-oyster-bay-loop-trail)*- 3 miles*
<br> This trail next to Oakland airport has no shade and low foot traffic. Watching the planes take off, and land at Oakland Airport was exciting. Undoubtedly, the views along the way are breathtaking. However, there is a noticeable unpleasant odor at the trailhead, likely due to the nearby Waste Management plant. Fortunately, as you venture further from the trailhead, the smell dissipates. On a positive note, the trail leads to a picturesque spot ideal for admiring beautiful sunsets.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> No designated parking, but you can park off Neptune Dr, Free<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available<br>
<mark>Condition:</mark> No Shade, best for sunsets<br>

9. [Hamilton Wetlands ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/san-francisco-bay-trail-to-hamilton-field-path) *- 4.4 mile, Elev Gain 49 ft*
<br>This hidden gem was truly wonderful! In the evening, it had a peaceful and beautiful atmosphere. Interestingly, Alltrails has recently associated it with the San Francisco Bay Trail and Hamilton Wetlands, creating a 9.6-mile hiking route. The trail now starts from Las Galinas Valley Parking lot. You can still enjoy this trail by doing a 4.4-mile round trip or or adjusting the distance as you prefer, skipping the remaining portion. <br><br>

12. [Lake Merced Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/lake-merced-loop)*- 4.5 mile, Elev Gain 127 ft*
<br>The trail experiences heavy traffic, as it is a loop, there are multiple parking lots available, allowing you to begin your journey from any point along the trail. Much of the trail runs alongside a bustling road, completely paved and ideal for strollers or children riding bikes. However, if you seek a tranquil stroll, it might be preferable to opt for an alternative. The presence of significant road noise requires you to be prepared for a less peaceful experience.<br><br>

<br>Experience a leisurely 6.6-mile stroll along the bay with no shade. Located near Oakland Airport, this trail offers a close-up view of incoming flights. While Marina Park tends to be bustling, the trail becomes super crowded during sunset. Don't pass up the opportunity to hike this route and witness the magic of the setting sun.<br><br>

14. [Montclair Railroad Trail Shepherd Canyon](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/montclair-railroad-trail-shepherd-canyon)*- 3.1 mile, Elev Gain 253 ft*
<br>If you're in the mood for a leisurely stroll surrounded by nature, this cute and easy paved trail might be just what you need. Located conveniently with street parking available, the trail offers a mostly shaded and paved path, making it perfect for a sunny day.<br>
However, finding the trailhead was tricky. Navigating through the right stairs took some time, and AllTrails might not be reliable. Though, as a fully accessible ramp on La Salle provides a smooth entry point, ensuring everyone can enjoy this beautiful trail. The initial section may pose a challenge for strollers due to stairs, but once past that hurdle, the trail is suitable for dogs, kids, and strollers alike. We saw a lot of people with strollers. <br><br>

15. [Napa River and Bay Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/napa-river-and-bay-trail)*- 5.7 mile, Elev Gain 43 ft*
<br>This park is a great spot for a relaxed walk and wildlife watching. The trail is partly paved, and it's suitable for those with children as strollers can be easily used. It is a paradise for bird-watching enthusiast. Our evening visit was special because we saw a beautiful sunset. The sky turned orange and pink, making the wetlands look magical. It made our already enjoyable outing even more enchanting.
If you enjoy nature and easy walks, this place is a gem!<br><br>
