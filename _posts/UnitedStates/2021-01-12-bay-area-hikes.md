Discover Bay Area's Hidden Gems with me as Your Trail Guide!


Let me be your guide to the hidden treasures of the Bay Area's breathtaking trails. Having hiked over 150 plus trails in the region, I've not only immersed myself in the diverse landscapes but meticulously documented each trail's nuances to ensure you have the most enriching outdoor experience possible. Whether you're a seasoned hiker or a novice adventurer, my passion is to provide you with detailed insights into each trail's difficulty, terrain, and unique features. From shaded strolls to sun-soaked challenges, I've got you covered.


I’ve had many exciting experiences on these hikes, encountering a myriad of wildlife, from playful bunnies to majestic elk, and even the occasional coyote. On at least six different trails, my encounters included observing fascinating snakes. Beyond the wildlife, one of the highlights of these journeys was the opportunity to explore numerous Bay Area towns for the first time, such as Tiburon, San Anselmo, Livermore, Fairfax, Hayward, Corte Madera, Saratoga, Felton, and Moraga, etc.
Explore the trails with confidence, knowing the best time to visit, the availability of restrooms, parking details, and any associated fees.


For your convenience, I've organized the trails into four categories: [easy](#easyTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, [moderate](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/bay-area-moderate-hikes#moderateTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, [hard](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/bay-area-hard-hikes#hardTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, and [walks](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/casual-strolls-in-bay-area#walks){: .js-no-ajax} based on their difficulty level. The 'walks' section is dedicated to gentle strolls with minimal elevation gain, perfect for those seeking a more relaxed outdoor experience.


I heavily rely on Alltrails for its invaluable insights. While it's a fantastic resource, I've noticed a slight variation in trail measurements—usually around 0.1 miles off, with minimal discrepancies in elevation gain. To provide you with the most latest information, each trail description below includes a link to the corresponding Alltrails page.


Additionally, I've marked the trailheads on a map, categorized according to difficulty level. This feature makes it easier for you to find trails nearest to you or select hikes in a particular area, ensuring a seamless and personalized exploration of the Bay Area's trails.



<b>*While hiking these trails, I made several observations that might be helpful for anyone interested in exploring them:*</b>



* Although some of these hikes may not be visually striking, I purposely timed 90% of them to coincide with sunset, which greatly enhanced the overall ambiance. The breathtaking sunsets and delicate pink hues created an indescribable atmosphere. My primary objective was to stay active and immerse myself in nature.
<br>
<br>
* I usually opted for hikes that had moderate to light foot traffic, avoiding heavily crowded ones unless I visited on weekdays.
<br>
<br>
* Regarding the debate of hiking in the morning versus the afternoon, I discovered that afternoons offered better chances of finding parking spots. I had always believed that mornings were the optimal time for hiking, but it turns out I was mistaken. Afternoons meant fewer crowds and readily available parking.
<br>
<br>
* Longer hikes mean fewer people. I noticed that longer hikes tended to have fewer people. Even when the parking lots were full, I rarely encountered more than ten individuals on such trails. I appreciated the tranquility and solitude of these hikes more.
<br>
<br>
* To locate and keep track of the hikes, I relied on AllTrails. I observed that around 99% of the hikes were actually 0.3 to 0.5 miles longer than what was initially stated on the AllTrails app. The free version of the app proved to be quite useful for navigating through all of these trails.
<br>


If you're seeking outdoor activities to stay active, I've gathered a collection of excellent options for you. Below is a comprehensive list of our hikes, complete with pertinent information and links to their respective AllTrails pages. All the trails mentioned in this list are either out-and-back or loop trails, except for the Dipsea Trail, which is a point-to-point trail, meaning it doesn't conclude at the same starting point.


*Happy Trails!*

# Easy Trails
{: id="easyTrails"}
<br>

1. [Sweeney Ridge ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/sweeney-ridge--2?ref=result-card)*- 5 mile, Elev Gain 750 ft*
<br>It is one of my favorites in the bay area. This trail is easy and paved but lacks shade. Situated between San Bruno and Pacifica, Sweeney Ridge consists of hilly terrain with several ridges. Notably, this ridge holds historical significance as the San Francisco Bay Discovery Site, marking the first sighting of San Francisco Bay by the Portolá expedition. As you reach the ridge, you'll come across abandoned buildings that were once part of the SF-51C Nike missile control defense system.<br>
The highlight of this hike was witnessing the captivating sight of fog rolling in as we approached the ridge. It created a breathtaking atmosphere, particularly during sunset. I highly recommend setting out on this hike around sunset when there is fog, as it provides the most remarkable experience. Views of the bay on one side and the ocean on the other, what more could you ask for? The sunset viewed from Sweeney Ridge remains one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, Free<br>

2. [Mount Tamalpais Middle Peak Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/mount-tamalpais-middle-peak-loop-trail)*- 5.9 miles Elev Gain 950 ft*
<br>The views at the top of the trail are absolutely gorgeous! 360 degrees breathtaking panoramic views. We found out that the actual distance is around 5.9ish miles, although AllTrails may show it as 5.3 miles. The trail provides ample shade, which is perfect for hot summer months. You'll encounter diverse terrain, including lush forests with pine trees, redwoods, and oaks, as well as rocky sections and uneven terrain. It's highly recommended to wear hiking shoes or boots, as the trail remains rocky throughout. Apart from a few steep sections, the trail is generally easy to navigate. With fewer people on the trail, it offers a peaceful and uncrowded experience. Keep in mind that there is an $8 parking fee, so make sure to bring some cash.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, self-registration $8 per vehicle, carry cash & pen<br>

<br>
3. [Dias Ridge Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/dias-ridge-trail--3)*- 6 miles Elev Gain 1100 ft*
<br>Certain sections of the trail can be narrow, requiring caution and awareness. Unfortunately, during my hike, I almost got hit by a cyclist head-on who was traveling at high speed, disregarding the fact that the trail is meant for hikers as well. This was the first time something like this happened after hiking in Bay Area for several years. It is essential for all trail users, including cyclists, to respect the shared use and adhere to trail rules, ensuring the safety and enjoyment of everyone on the trail.
The trail is well-marked and overgrown in some sections, but overall pretty maintained. It winds through rolling hills covered in vibrant wildflowers during the spring and summer months. The highlight of the Dias Ridge Trail is undoubtedly the breathtaking views it offers. As you hike along the ridge, you'll be treated to sweeping vistas of the Pacific Ocean, the San Francisco Bay, and the surrounding Marin County landscape.<br><br>

<br>A comfortable 6-mile stroll that's not overly busy on weekdays, although you'll encounter a significant number of bikers. The views of San Andreas Lake are nice. This trail is closed due to storm damage as of June 2023. I'll update it if and when it reopens.<br><br>

<br>Easy out-and-back hike with some great views of San Pablo Bay. The trail winds through a dry landscape, nestled within an evergreen forest and oak woodland. As you explore, you'll encounter a variety of majestic trees, including coast live oak, California black oak, manzanita, and madrone. We had the pleasure of spotting numerous deer and squirrels along the way. The visitor station has limited parking, but you can find ample space along the side of the road. While this trail is primarily used by bikers, we found ourselves frequently stepping off the trail to accommodate them, roughly every ten steps. As you traverse the path, you'll encounter partial shade, but if you go after 4:00 pm, you'll find yourself mostly shielded from the sun as the hills in the west obstruct it.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, $3 for hikers/runners & $5 for carpark<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available<br>

<br>The trail around the lake spans more than 9 miles. The majority of the route is paved and wide, generally well-maintained and clean. It is relatively easy with gradual inclines, suitable for occasional hikers. Most of the route offers views of the lake. To avoid crowds, we opted to hike it on a weekday, which proved to be less busy. Also, it's very hard to find parking on weekends.<br><br>

<br>
8. [Fort Funston Coastal Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/fort-funston-coastal-trail)*- 2 mile, Elev Gain 160 ft*
<br>Enjoy breathtaking coastal views on an effortless stroll along the coast.  Whether it's immersed in ethereal fog or bathed in radiant sunlight, Fort Funston's beauty transcends weather conditions. We had the opportunity to experience both scenarios, and each day was equally enchanting. Keep in mind that it's typically windy at the location, adding to the unique atmosphere. Also note that the trail consists of a mix of paved sections and sandy terrain, so it's advisable to wear suitable footwear if you wish to keep your shoes clean. The route provided by AllTrails leads to a small two-car parking lot, but there's a larger parking area near the observation deck. On the map, I've designated the larger lot as the trailhead. The park gate closes one hour past sunset, and you'll find portable toilets available at the trailhead. Fort Funston isn't just renowned for its magnificent vistas; it's also a popular hub for hang-gliding enthusiasts. A must-do!<br><br>

<br> Beautiful coastal views, with a variety of wildflowers, adding bursts of color to the landscape. It can be quite windy, especially by the ocean, so it's advisable to bring appropriate clothing. The trail conditions can be slippery in certain areas, so wearing sturdy shoes is recommended. Due to its popularity, Mori Point can get crowded, so doing it on a weekday is a good idea to secure parking and enjoy a more serene experience. On foggy days, the mist adds a mystical touch to the surroundings. Overall a must-visit. <br><br>

<br>Located just a few miles south of Carmel-by-the-Sea and a short drive from San Francisco or Big Sur, this trail offers visitors a chance to immerse themselves in stunning natural beauty. The diverse range of environments, from vibrant Monterey pine and Cypress groves to picturesque coastal shrub-covered cliffs, provide sweeping ocean vistas. Keep an eye out, as this area is teeming with wildlife. We saw harbor seals, otters, and sea lions, plus tons of Pelicans. The Point Lobos State Natural Reserve has a well-maintained network of hiking trails.

<br>Wildcat Peak offers a truly phenomenal view that is sure to leave you breathless. From the peak, you can enjoy panoramic vistas of the entire East Bay, San Francisco, Marin, and the Golden Gate Bridge, extending all the way up north. However, reaching the summit via Nimitz Way may not be the most enjoyable part of the hike, as it follows a paved road throughout. Nonetheless, once you veer off onto the hiking trail just before Peace Grove, the experience becomes much more pleasant. Despite starting the hike on a Sunday evening, the trail was heavily trafficked, so if you have the flexibility, avoid visiting on weekends. the trail's actual distance measured approximately 6.3 miles, which is slightly longer.<br><br>

<br>It is a highly sought-after destination for hiking and running enthusiasts. It was no surprise that we encountered tons of people along the way. The highlight of the trip was reaching Inspiration Point, which offered a pleasant view. However, I must admit that I've seen trails with even more breathtaking vistas. Despite this, the overall experience of exploring the area was worthwhile. If you're looking for a popular spot for hiking and running, this area is a great choice, but if you're seeking the absolute best views, you might want to consider exploring other trails nearby.<br><br>

It combines existing park paths with fourteen "musing stations" that highlight the area's ecology, geography, and history. These are a point to pause and reflect on mind, body, and soul in conjunction with the natural surrounding. We hiked it at sunrise, and it was an amazing experience, blending the beauty of nature with moments of reflection. Highly recommended for those seeking inspiration and connection with the surroundings.<br><br>

<br> Instead of beginning our journey from the Sharp Park Road trailhead, we opted to start from the Connemara Drive parking lot. ([Refer the map for the Connemara Drive trailhead](#trailheadsMap){: .js-no-ajax}  ) Please note that parking availability is limited at both trailheads. As we embarked on our hike, we were immediately rewarded with stunning views of the ocean and Pacifica, especially as the sun began to set. The scenery was truly picturesque, and we couldn't help but feel awe-inspired by the sweeping vistas. A couple of steep sections, but overall it is an easy hike. With only 4-5 individuals crossing our path, we relished the tranquility and solitude that the trail offered.<br><br>

The best part is that it forms a loop, allowing you to begin your hike from any point you prefer. Along the trail, you'll find three convenient parking lots; do keep in mind that there is an $8 parking fee. We did this trail on a sunny Sunday afternoon, we were initially concerned about the anticipated crowds.

<br>Straightforward 3-mile trail with abundant scenic beauty, though lacking in shade. Despite its popularity, the way to beat the crowds is to do it on a weekday which should ensure a peaceful experience.

<br>3.4 miles roundtrip, no shade. One of many ways to get to Sweeney Ridge, which is so beautiful during foggy evenings. It ranks among my top ten hikes this year, but the magic truly unfolds when the fog rolls in. Be cautious of bikers, as certain sections are narrow and lack areas to step aside.

31. [Tarwater Trail Loopl Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tarwater-trail-loop)*- 5 mile, Elev Gain 750 ft*
<br>The trailhead parking is situated along a narrow, winding road, and the last mile can be challenging with potholes. As you begin the hike, the initial first mile descends under the sun, while the rest of the hike provides abundant shade, rendering it a superb option for a warm day.
The forest, dominated by coast redwood ferns and other shade-loving plants thrive in the lower elevations.
We did it on a Sunday afternoon, and encountered minimal crowds, crossing paths with only three other people. Recent rainfall resulted in muddy sections along the trail but despite the mud, the hike was so pretty especially the redwood grove. One notable aspect we appreciated was the extraordinary silence, as not even a hint of wind disturbed the tranquility. The scent of the surroundings was particularly pleasant due to the recent rains.<br>
We thoroughly enjoyed this hike and plan to do it again. It provided a serene and beautiful escape, with the redwood grove standing out as a highlight.<br>
**Important Note:** A fellow hiker we met at the trailhead shared a cautionary tale about ticks on her dog. It's advisable to be cautious and aware of ticks in the area during your hike.<br><br>

<br>Old Railroad Grade Fire Road in Mill Valley is a fantastic hiking spot. The trail is suitable for various skill levels, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced hikers. It follows an old railroad route, perfect for a leisurely escape into nature. The path is well-maintained, with a gradual incline that makes it accessible for beginners. The packed dirt trail is easy on the knees, and there are shaded areas to cool off on warmer days. It wasn't busy; we only encountered a few bikers during our visit.<br>
Parked alongside Fern Canyon Road, where parking is limited to only 2 to 3 cars. Alternatively, you can park at the trail's end on W Blithedale Ave.<br><br>

33. [Rodeo Lagoon to Point Bonita Lighthouse](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/rodeo-lagoon-to-point-bonita-lighthouse)*- 4.4 miles, Elev Gain 406 ft*
<br>Keep in mind that the section leading directly to the Point Bonita lighthouse is accessible only during limited hours each week. We hiked around sunrise, and the lighthouse was closed. So the trail is 3.62 miles long, and if the lighthouse is closed. However, if the lighthouse is open, the total distance increases to 4.4 miles. Nevertheless, it was the best sunrise we saw in the Bay Area, offering gorgeous views of the ocean, Golden Gate Bridge, and the city. It was truly breathtaking. Started the hike at 6:30 am, and to my surprise, the parking lot was completely empty—no cars at all, especially unexpected for a weekend.
Descending back to the beach was tricky, some sketchy sections, might pose challenges with stability concerns, hiking poles could be useful.<br>
Excellent trail—highly recommend catching the sunrise.<br><br>

<br>If you're seeking some fresh air outdoors and peaceful time, this is the perfect choice. The trail is relatively uneventful, with no breathtaking views. It mainly traverses through a valley and a small section of the forest. This trail is not heavily trafficked, so finding parking was easy. There were hardly any people on this trail. You can choose either to park at Bort Meadow staging area or Clyde Woolride staging area.<br><br>

<br>This hike is adorned with trees and the soothing melody of a creek. The well-shaded path provides minimal washout, picturesque spots for photography, and an overall peaceful ambiance. A worthwhile journey for those seeking diverse nature experiences.<br>

36. [Round Top, Volcanic & Skyline Trail Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/round-top-volcanic-and-skyline-trail-loop)*- 3.8 mile, Elevation Gain 554 ft*
<br>This is a easy trail in Orinda, and most of it was nicely shaded, making it a comfortable walk. I went on a Saturday evening, and finding parking was a breeze. While the hike was great overall, there were a few spots that were flooded, so be prepared for that. However, it didn't spoil the fun, and the rest of the trail made up for it with beautiful scenery. It's fascinating to learn that Round Top is made up of lava and volcanic debris from a volcano that existed around 10 million years ago. If you're interested in learning more about the geological features of the park, the park website offers a fantastic self-guided tour. The tour covers information about the vista points and details about Sibley Volcanic. You can find it *[here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3e80aa360f98479b92ac4264af0aa04a).*<br><br>

<br>This trail in Redwood Reinhardt Regional Park is a fantastic hiking trail, especially if you enjoy forest hikes like I do. It's like finding a hidden gem right in the heart of the city! But one downside is that it can get quite heavily trafficked. Due to its convenient urban location, the trail attracts many visitors, especially during peak times. The trail takes you through an amazing forest with towering redwood trees, the lush green surroundings and the refreshing air make it a perfect place to connect with nature. The loop offers a good mix of terrain, and the well-maintained trail ensures a pleasant hiking experience. If you're looking for a rejuvenating walk in a beautiful forest within an urban setting, this trail is definitely worth exploring.<br><br>

38. [Skyline Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/skyline-trail--3)*- 6.6 miles, Elev Gain 800 ft*
<br>The trail, labeled as having a 1330 ft elevation gain, was a bit misleading as it turned out to be around 800 ft. Despite this hiccup, the well-maintained path proved to be an easy trek, contradicting the moderate difficulty assigned to it on Alltrails. The trail leads you into a peaceful forest, predominantly flat with occasional gentle ups and downs. One noticeable drawback is the proximity to Hwy 35, resulting in intermittent traffic noise along certain parts of the trail. This can be a bit distracting for those seeking complete serenity. It's an ideal setting for forest bathing, lush greenery and the soothing shade provided by the towering oak and redwood trees allowing everyone to immerse themselves in the calming ambiance of nature.<br>
Keep an eye out for poison oak.<br><br>

<br>It was super amazing at sunrise. I chose to explore this trail at sunrise in February, when the hills in the Bay Area are lush green due to the January rains. The scenery was absolutely stunning, with the vibrant greenery of the rolling hills creating a picturesque backdrop. This trail is more like a walk than a strenuous hike, making it accessible for various fitness levels. It's important to note that there is minimal shade along the trail, so it's advisable to plan accordingly. Wearing sunscreen, a hat, and bringing plenty of water is essential, especially during warmer months.<br><br>

<br>Few inclines in some places but otherwise an easy trail. I spotted wildflowers, birds, and even a few squirrels. The trail is clearly marked, making it easy to navigate. Additionally, take into consideration that the trail provides partial shade, so plan accordingly. Personally, I opted for an evening hike, which spared me from any issues with the sun. However, it could become quite hot, especially during other times of the day.<br><br>

<br>The Alambique Trail part of this hike is an unpaved service road which serves as the gateway to Skyline, featuring key destinations like "Alambique Flat" and "The Crossroads," each have inviting benches. En route to Alambique Flat, you encounter Wunderlich's largest redwood, preserved from logging due to its distinctive features. This then connects to Bear Gulch Trail which is a single-track path winding through a mixed forest, from stables uphill through bay, Douglas fir, tan oak, and madrone. Finally the route connects to the Redwood Trail which is a path through mixed forest dominated by majestic redwoods. While all part of a single hike, these interconnected trails offer distinct experiences as they traverse diverse surroundings. Some lead through expansive meadows, while others wind through enchanting forests, providing a varied and captivating journey within Wunderlich Park.<br><br>
*Trivia - James A Folger II of the Folgers Coffee Company purchased property here and built the Folger Stable. The stable and adjoining land were sold to Martin Wunderlich, who later donated it to the county for a public park.*<br><br>
