We have lived in San Francisco for five years now but never got a chance to explore many hikes in the area due to our extensive travels. Apart from a handful of the most popular ones. When the pandemic started, I remember how we would go to our secret spot on the Coastal Fire Road to smell the trees. Then in June, I finally decided to find some unpopular hikes(so that we don't come across many people) in the bay area :) for some forest bathing and to stay active. Since then, we have completed 44 hikes and at least 50+ walks to Oyster Point (another hidden gem). Many exciting experiences on these hikes, saw so much wildlife - coming across snakes on at least six different trails, so many cute bunnies, a few coyotes, tons of Elks. The other thing that happened was, for the first time, we got to see the downtowns of so many bay area towns, like, Tiburon, San Anselmo, Livermore, Fairfax, Hayward, Corte Madera, Saratoga, Felton, Moraga.<br><br>
There are few things that I noticed while hiking these trails which might help anyone interested in doing them:
<br>
* Some of you might not find these hikes as beautiful, so we did ninety percent of them around sunset. Doing them around sunset made a huge difference. Those spectacular sunsets, pink hues on the other side, I can't put it in words. And the other thing was our main goal was to stay active and spend some time in nature.
<br>
<br>
* I usually chose light and moderately trafficked ones, leaving the few heavily trafficked ones we did on weekdays.
<br>
<br>
* In the morning vs. afternoon debate, afternoons faired much better when it comes down to finding a parking spot. I always thought that morning was the best time to go hiking. I am afraid I was wrong. Afternoon means lesser crowds and easily available parking.
<br>
<br>
* Longer hikes, fewer people. No matter how much the parking lots were full, we hardly came across, I would say, not more than ten people on such trails. Loved the quietness and the solitude.
<br>
<br>
* I used Alltrails to find and record them. 99% of the hikes are at least 0.3 - 0.5 miles more than stated on the Alltrails. Their free version is reasonably useful to get you through all these hikes.
<br>

So if you just want to get out and move, here are some good options. I have compiled all the hikes we did, with their details, links to Alltrails. <br><br>

*[See on map](/unitedstates/bay-area-hikes#trailheadsMap){: .js-no-ajax}*
<br>
<br>

1. [Tomales Point Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tomales-point-trail)*- 10 mile*
<br>10 miles out and back trail, no shade. One of the best trails we did this year. Excellent hike! Lots of Elks, amazing views at the end and throughout. We encountered a snake as well and saw one of the coolest sunsets ever.
I highly recommend this one!!
<br>
<br>
2. [Berry Creek Falls Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/berry-creek-falls-trail)*- 13 mile*
<br>It's a 13 mile moderately hard trail with lots of shade. Great workout hike. Took us 4hrs 13 mins to complete it. Make sure to have some snacks & enough water, it's a strenuous hike. Also, have the trail map handy because if you get lost or take some detour, it will add more miles and time and only make it harder.
<br>
<br>
[3. Fall Creek and Lost Empire Trail Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/fall-creek)*- 11 mile*
<br>11 mile hard trail, lots of shade. I felt this was harder than the Berry Creek Falls trail, although it is marked 'moderate' on alltrails. Again carry plenty of water and food, and download an offline map.
<br>
<br>
4. [Rodeo Valley Loop and Slacker Hill ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/rodeo-valley-loop-and-slacker-hill)*- 6.2 mile*
<br> 6.2 miles moderate hike, gradual elevation gain, no shade. Black Sands Beach via Julian Trail and this trail share the same trailhead. Also, this is a loop, so you can start from some other trailhead. 5 years of living in the bay area and not been to Slacker hill, I know that's embarrassing. :)
<br>The viewpoint is super amazing, with awesome views of the GGB, city, ocean and the bay. A must-do! Just avoid weekends.
<br>
<br>
5. [Fordyce Falls Via Spaulding Lake Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/fordyce-falls-via-spaulding-lake-trail)*- 11 miles*
<br>11 mile moderate hike. I think it's rated moderate only because of the distance. Please download some offline maps or read the map before heading to this trail. The trail is not even marked on google maps.
<br>
<br>
6. [Point Lobos Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/point-lobos-loop-trail)*- 6.7 mile*
<br>6.7 miles easy hike, gorgeous views, especially the pelican area. Since this is a loop, you can start from anywhere, there are multiple parking lots. A tiny section of the trail was closed for restoration.
<br>
<br>
7. [Almaden Quicksilver McAbee Mine Trail New Almaden Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/almaden-quicksilver-mcabee-mine-trail-new-almaden-trail) *- 9.5 mile*
<br>9.5 mile easy trail. Usually, it is heavily trafficked, so we did it on a weekday. Also, there was a warning of a mountain lion at the trailhead. Many people on the trails were not wearing masks or making any effort to distance themselves, especially the runners.
<br>
<br>
8. [Old Springs, Miwok, Wolf Ridge, Coastal and Tennessee Valley Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/old-springs-miwok-wolf-ridge-coastal-and-tennessee-valley-loop)*- 4.9 mile*
<br>4.9 miles, almost no shade. This trail and the Tennessee Valley trail share the same trailhead. We did this hike on a weekday, though it is not a popular trail but the parking lot was almost full around 6:00 pm when we reached. I guess most of the traffic was for Tennessee Beach and other hikes that start from this trailhead. We only came across a handful of people on the trail. If you are looking for a less crowded hike on a weekday, I would certainly suggest this one.
<br>
<br>
9. [McNee Ranch to Planet of the Apes ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mcnee-ranch-to-planet-of-the-apes)*- 5.8 mile*
<br>Nice hike! Mostly not shaded. A couple of steep sections. I would suggest wearing proper footwear since coming down could be a problem. Very limited parking at the trailhead on Highway 1, could only fit about six cars or so. But you can always park at the Montara State Beach parking, which is just .2 miles from the trailhead. Alltrails shows an inaccurate distance of 4.8miles. Did it counterclockwise and it happened to be around 5.8 miles (moderately difficult counterclockwise)
<br>
<br>
10. [Lake Chabot: West Shore, Bass Cove, Columbine, Honker Bay, East Shore Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/lake-chabot-west-shore-bass-cove-columbine-honker-bay-east-shore-loop)*- 9.3 miles*
<br>9.3ish mile trail around the lake. Most of the section is paved and broad, making it easier to maintain social distancing. Since it is a heavily trafficked trail, we did it on a weekday and it wasn't crowded.
<br>
<br>
11. [Mount Tamalpais Middle Peak Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/mount-tamalpais-middle-peak-loop-trail)*- 5.3 mile*
<br>It is 5.8ish but alltrails shows 5.3 miles. There is a parking fee of $8 (Please carry a pen for self registration)
<br>
<br>
12. [Seaborg and Mariposa Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/seaborg-and-mariposa-loop-trail)*- 7.5 mile*
<br>7.5 miles moderately hard hike in Briones Regional Park. Great views of Mt Diablo. It was one of the hikes we didn't come across anyone except for the people in the parking lot. It was kind of calm & serene to have it all to yourself. Carry plenty of water if you are planning to do it on a sunny, hot day.
<br>
<br>
13. [Bayshore trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/bayshore-trail)*- 5.3 mile*
<br>5.3 mile easy walk by the bay in Milbrae, I would say it was moderately trafficked for a weekday. It is next to the runaway, so you get awesome views of the flights coming in. Do it around sunset.
<br>
<br>
14. [Tiburon Waterfront ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tiburon-waterfront)*- 6 mile*
<br> 6 mile easy walk. No shade.
<br>
<br>
15. [King Canyon Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/kings-canyon-loop-trail)*- 7.3 mile*
<br>Alltrails shows 6.4 miles, but I recorded 7.32 miles on alltrails and 7.1 on my watch, so I am not sure how much it would be, but definitely more than 6.4. It was quite empty considering we did it on Sunday afternoon, it was overcast that day. So probably clouds and cold were the reason we came across very few people.
<br>
<br>
16. [Sawyer Camp Trail: San Andreas Lake to Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/sawyer-camp-trail-san-andreas-lake-to-lower-crystal-springs-reservoir)*- 6 mile*
<br>6 miles easy walk. Not much crowded on a weekday, a lot of bikers though. Awesome views of San Andreas Lake.
<br>
<br>
17. [Hazelnut Trail and Weiler Ranch Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/hazelnut-trail-and-weiler-ranch-loop)*- 4.7 miles*
<br> 4.7 mile moderate hike, partially shaded. Since it was a one-way trail, didn’t encounter a lot of people. The park gate closes at sunset, so you could park outside on the street. Warning of a mountain lion at the trailhead.
<br>
<br>
18. [Saddle Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/saddle-loop-trail)*- 3 mile*
<br>3 miles easy trail, partly shaded. Stunning around sunset! Gorgeous views of the SF skyline and the bay!
<br>
<br>
19. [Cogswell Marsh Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/cogswell-marsh-hayward-regional-shoreline)*- 6 mile*
<br>6 mile easy walk, do it around sunset! It's absolutely stunning!!
 We started from the San Mateo bridge trailhead(instead trailhead at 37.64686260437708, -122.14515486561974). It was much easier to find parking there.
<br>
<br>
20. [Mori Point Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/mori-point-trail--2)*- 3 mile*
<br>3 mile easy trail in Pacifica, heavily trafficked. Avoid weekends or holidays.
<br>
<br>
21. [SF Bay Trail: Roberts Landing to Marina Park ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/sf-bay-trail-roberts-landing-to-marina-park)*- 6.6 mile*
<br>6.6 miles easy walk by the bay, no shade. It is nearby Oakland Airport so you get a very close view of the flights coming in. Super awesome at sunset though marina Park was super crowded.
<br>
<br>
22. [SF Bay Trail: Interpretive Center to Hayward Landing ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/sf-bay-trail-interpretive-center-to-hayward-landing)*- 9.2 mile*
<br>9.2 mile easy walk by the bay, super super amazing at sunset.
<br>
<br>
23. [Black Sands Beach via Julian Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/black-sands-beach-via-julian-trail)*- 4.2 mile*
<br>4.2 mile moderate hike in Marin Headlands, no shade. Steep at some spots and you need to climb down/up some stairs going to the beach. The black sand beach is gorgeous. Rodeo Valley Loop and Slacker Hill and this trail share the same trailhead. Did it on a weekday so wasn't much crowded. A must-visit.
<br>
<br>
24. [Sweeney Ridge ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/sweeney-ridge--2?ref=result-card)*- 5 mile*
<br>5 mile easy hike, paved, no shade. My favorite hike this year. It was so amazing to see fog flowing in when we reached the ridge. It was one o the best sunsets this year. Do it around sunset when there is fog.
<br>
<br>
25. [Baquiano Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/baquaiano-trail?ref=result-card)*- 3.4 mile*
<br>3.4 miles roundtrip, no shade. This one also goes up to Sweeney ridge, which is so beautiful during foggy evenings. One of my top ten hikes this year(only if there is fog:) )
<br>
<br>
26. [Sweeney Ridge Trail via Mori Ridge ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/sweeney-ridge-trail-via-mori-ridge)*- 5 mile*
<br>5 mile moderate hike in Pacifica. The first mile is quite a killer, particularly hurts your knees so bad while coming down. All three trails join the Sweeney Ridge and the views are spectacular, ocean on one side and bay on the other.
<br>
<br>
27. [Cooley Landing Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/cooley-landing-trail)*- 3.2 mile*
<br> 3.2 mile easy walk, no shade. Next to Palo Alto airport and golf course. Do it around sunset.
<br>
<br>
28. [White Hill Fire Road ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/white-hill-fire-road)*- 7.5 mile*
<br>It was around 7.5 miles, alltrails shows 6.5, easy hike not crowded at all. Very few parking spaces available. Around 1 mile from the trailhead take the porcupine trail where it connects with White hill fire road. The alltrails suggested route is closed. Porcupine trail joins the white hill fire road ahead after about .3miles.
<br>
<br>
29. [Clarkia, Sunset, Live Oak and Serpentine Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/clarkia-sunset-live-oak-and-serpentine-loop)*- 3 mile*
<br> 3 mile roundtrip, no spectacular views, just if you want a nature walk without the crowds. There is no designated parking, but you can park by the side of the road.
<br>
<br>
30. [East Shore, Ridgeline, East Ridge Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/east-shore-ridgeline-east-ridge-loop)*- 5.3 mile*
<br>5.3 mile easy hike, lightly trafficked, almost no shade. Lovely views of Lake Del Valle, it was so quiet and peaceful!
<br>
<br>
31. [Tennessee Valley Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tennessee-valley-trail)*- 3.6 mile*
<br> 3.6 mile easy walk, almost no shade. Super heavily trafficked. Initially, we had planned for another trail that day, but I guess we got late to reach the trailhead and were turned away by the park ranger. So we did Tennessee Valley on a Saturday evening. Although the beach was stunning at sunset, it was way too crowded. We intend to go there again after the pandemic. But if you could, please avoid this one for the time being.
<br>
<br>
32. [San Francisco Bay Trail Loop San Leandro ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/san-francisco-bay-trail-loop--3)*- 3 mile*
<br> 3 mile easy walk, no shade, lightly trafficked. Views are no doubt amazing but there is always some horrible smell at the trailhead, probably because of the Waste Management plant nearby. But the good thing is as you get past the trailhead, the smell disappears. There is some construction going on as well. Good sunset point.
<br>
<br>
33. [Los Trancos Trail Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/los-trancos-trail-loop)*- 7.7 mile*
<br>7.7 miles easy hike, great for forest bathing. I just loved it, the smell of the trees after the rains, it was heavenly. Pretty gradual elevation gain. The best thing was it was one way due to Covid making it pretty safe to hike and without worrying about crossing anyone.
<br>
<br>
34. [Alta Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/alta-trail--2)*- 4.9 mile*
<br>4.9 miles easy trail, great views of Sausalito, Bay and the Ocean. Do it around sunset.
<br>
<br>
35. [Ring Mountain Fire Road ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/ring-mountain-fire-road)*- 4.7 mile*
<br>4.7 miles, No Shade. Alltrails incorrectly show 4.1 miles, also it is more than 800ft in elevation gain not 669ft as stated on alltrails. Amazing views of the city and bay! The only downside is there is no parking at the trailhead, so you need to park somewhere down the street.
<br>
<br>
36. [Castle Rocks Lower Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/castle-rocks-lower-loop)*- 6.5 mile*
<br>6.5 mile excellent trail but heavily trafficked up until it meets the interconnector trail. It was so crowded that it came to a standstill for 15 minutes, queuing up at least 30 people. But not a soul after that point.  I guess most people do other trails, so I would suggest avoiding it on weekends.
<br>
<br>
37. [Bullhead Flat to Back Ranch Meadows Campground via Shoreline Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/bullhead-flat-to-back-ranch-meadows-campground-via-shoreline-trail)*- 8.2 mile*
<br>8.2 miles easy out & back hike. Awesome views of the bay. There is a $3 fee for hikers/runners and a $5 for a car park. Although there is limited parking at the vistor station but there are plently of spots on the side of the road. Mainly this trail is used by the bikers and sadly most of them were not wearing masks. Since the trails is narrow, we ended up stepping off the trail quite a bit( I mean every 10 steps) to make room for these unmasked bikers.
<br>
<br>
38. [Milagra Overlook Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/milagra-overlook-trail)*- 2.8 mile*
<br>2.8 mile easy roundtrip trail. A few steep sections. We started it from the Connemara dr parking lot instead of Sharp Park Road trailhead. Parking is minimal at both the trailheads. It was beautiful at sunset, you get sweeping views of the Ocean and Pacifica. We came across only 4-5 people.
<br>
<br>
39. [Newark Slough Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/don-edwards-san-francisco-bay-national-wildlife-refuge-newark-slough-trail)*- 6.5 mile*
<br>6.5 miles easy trail, these days a little over 6.7, since they have closed the road before the bridge. Though it’s moderately trafficked, but we didn’t come across even a single person on the trail. There were people at the trailhead and some around the hill, I was surprised to find it empty for a Saturday afternoon. Probably other hikes/walks in the area are more popular. Great trail to do during covid.
<br>
<br>
40. [Nimitz Way Trail to Inspiration Peak and Jewel Lake ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/nimitz-way-trail-to-inspiration-peak-and-jewel-lake)*- 6 mile*
<br>6 miles, easy hike. It was great, even though we started on late Sunday afternoon, it was heavily trafficked. If possible, avoid it on weekends. It's also hard to get parking.
<br>
<br>
41. [Dipsea Trail from Mill Valley to Muir Woods and back ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/dipsea-trail-from-mill-valley-trail-head)*- 5 mile*
<br> 5 mile moderate trail. We decided not to do the full Dipsea trail this time due to the pandemic since we were not comfortable taking the bus back from Stinson Beach. So we decided to do it halfway and back. We have done the entire trail several times on previous occasions but wanted to avoid it for now.
<br>
<br>
42. [Limantour Beach Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/limantour-beach-trail)*- 5.4 mile*
<br>5.4 mile out and back amazing beach walk.
<br>
<br>
43. [Philosopher's Way ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/philosophers-way)*- 2.9 mile*
<br>The Philosopher's Way or walk is shaped after similar designed walking paths in Japan, Germany, and Canada. There are stations or musings placed at some intervals not just to show you the way but they are a point to pause and reflect on mind, body and soul in conjunction with the natural surrounding.
<br>
<br>
44. [Ecology Trail and Lovers' Lane Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/ecology-trail-and-lovers-lane-loop)*- 2 mile*
<br> 2 mile trail in Presidio. It was a mistake to go on this one, it was the most crowded trail of the year.
<br>
<br>

## 2021


45. [Bon Tempe and Lagunitas Lakes Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/bon-tempe-and-lagunitas-lakes-trail)*- 6 mile, Elevation Gain 505 ft*
<br>Easy trail, partially shaded. It is more than 6 miles; alltrails inaccurately list it as 5.5 miles. Again since it's a loop, you can start from anywhere. There are three parking lots. There is a parking fee of $8. We did it on a Sunday afternoon, and the parking lots were full. We thought it's going to be crowded. But apparently, most of the people were there for fishing, very few people hiking. The lakes are beautiful, it's a must-do!!
<br>
<br>
46. [Mount Diablo Grand Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mount-diablo-grand-loop)*- 7 mile, Elevation Gain 2,000 ft*
<br>It's a challenging hike with lots of elevation. Begins downhill, then a constant exhausting climb to the Mt Diablo summit. Could be very narrow at certain spots. We did it clockwise on a Sunday evening, there were hardly any people. Parking was easily available at the Diablo Valley Overlook. The views were gorgeous. We made it just in time to catch a fantastic sunset from the summit.<br>
Must do!
<br>
<br>
47. [Montara Mountain Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/montara-mountain-trail--3)*- 7 mile, Elevation Gain 1,677 ft*
<br>Moderate trail, partially shaded. The ascent is pretty gradual. I was very surprised that we started around 8:00 am on a Sunday, and still, we met very few people on the trail. The views are impressive; you get to see both - the bay and the ocean. I recommend it; the sun could be really harsh later in the day, so either plan for early morning or late afternoon.
<br>
<br>
48. [Point Pinole Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/point-pinole-cooks-point-marsh-owl-alley-china-cove-pinole-point-and-bay-view-trails)*- 4.2 mile, Elevation Gain 177 ft*
<br>4.2 miles lightly trafficked. It's a beautiful walk in the woods & by the bay (yep, you get both the worlds). Came across very few people with great views of the bay! There is a nice pier as well!
<br>
<br>
49. [Rodeo Beach Coastal Trail Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/rodeo-beach-coastal-trail-loop)*- 5.1 mile, Elevation Gain 1,030 ft*
<br>Moderate trail, no shade. Panoramic views of the Ocean and Rodeo Beach! There are a couple of steep sections, but manageable. We did it on a Sunday afternoon; surprisingly, the trail was quite empty despite the beach being too crowded. The parking lot is huge, and we easily got a spot. And most of the people were wearing masks!
<br>
<br>
50. [Kirby Cove ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/kirby-cove)*- 3 mile, Elevation Gain 561 ft*
<br>3 mile easy trail, not shaded. The views are gorgeous. Although it is a heavily trafficked trail, it shouldn't be that bad if you plan to go on a weekday. We did it on a Wednesday evening, didn't come across a single person. Plenty of parking at the trailhead.
<br>
<br>
51. [Nora Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/nora-trail)*- 4 mile, Elevation Gain 800 ft*
<br>Moderate trail, shaded. Pretty awesome!! Hardly any people on the trail. We did it on Sunday evening and was easy to find parking. It was around 4 miles and more than 800 ft of elevation gain (alltrails has different stats). So plan accordingly.
<br>
<br>
52. [Fort Point - Baker Beach Coast Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/fort-point-baker-beach-coast-trail)*- 4 mile, Elevation Gain 800 ft*
<br>Easy trail, not shaded. Lots of stairs, the views are amazing. It was pretty crowded for a tuesday evening.
Ninenty percent of the people were unmasked. So avoid it until the Covid ends.
<br>
<br>
53. [Lake Merced Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/lake-merced-loop)*- 4.5 mile, Elevation Gain 127 ft*
<br>Heavily trafficked, easy walk. There are several parking lots since it's a loop, you can start from anywhere. I wouldn’t recommend it, a lot of people without masks! (did it on a weekday)
<br>
<br>
54. [Napa River and Bay Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/napa-river-and-bay-trail)*- 5.7 mile, Elevation Gain 43 ft*
<br>Easy walk, not shaded. Very few people, lots of birds. Do it around sunset.
<br>
