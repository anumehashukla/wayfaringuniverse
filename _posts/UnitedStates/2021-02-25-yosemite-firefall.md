For the last four years, I have been trying to watch this unbelievable nature's show. A lot of conditions need to fall in place to see it. With so many cancellations over the years, I finally got lucky this time.<br>

In mid-to-late February, Yosemite National Park offers a chance to view the most magical natural phenomenon ever. When the conditions are perfect, the setting sun hits Horsetail Falls at just the right angle to light up the waterfall turning the hues from yellow to deep orange. You just have a short window of about 10 minutes to experience the Horsetail Falls glowing like lava.

```
if (no major winter storm) {
  // park is accessible

   if (enough water in falls) {

      if (falls arent frozen) {

         if (you get the park permit) {

            if (you get a good spot to stand/shoot) {
              // which is the hardest one, need to be at the spot no later than 1:00 pm

               if (western sky clear at sunset) {
                // not even a single cloud, trust me

                  // VOILA!!!! YOU GET TO SEE THE FIREFALL

               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
} else {
  // REPEAT PROCESS NEXT YEAR
}
```
