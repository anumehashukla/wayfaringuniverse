**Discover Bay Area's Hidden Gems with me as Your Trail Guide!**


Let me be your guide to the hidden treasures of the Bay Area's breathtaking trails. Having hiked over <mark>150 plus trails</mark> in the region, I've not only immersed myself in the diverse landscapes but meticulously documented each trail's nuances to ensure you have the most enriching outdoor experience possible. Whether you're a seasoned hiker or a novice adventurer, my focus is to provide you with detailed insights into each <mark>trail's difficulty, terrain, best time to visit, the availability of restrooms, parking details, and unique features. From shaded strolls to sun-soaked challenges,</mark> I've got you covered.


For your convenience, <mark>I've organized the trails into four categories:</mark> [easy](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/bay-area-hikes#easyTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, [moderate](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/bay-area-moderate-hikes#moderateTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, [hard](#hardTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, and [walks](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/casual-strolls-in-bay-area#walks){: .js-no-ajax} based on their difficulty level. The 'walks' section is dedicated to gentle strolls with minimal elevation gain, perfect for those seeking a more relaxed outdoor experience.


<mark>Additionally, I've marked the trailheads on a map, categorized according to difficulty level.</mark> This feature makes it easier for you to find trails nearest to you or select hikes in a particular area, ensuring a seamless and personalized exploration of the Bay Area's trails.

<b>*While hiking these trails, I made several observations that might be helpful for anyone interested in exploring them:*</b>
<br>
<br>

* Although some of these hikes may not be visually striking, **I purposely timed 90% of them to coincide with sunset,** which greatly enhanced the overall ambiance. The breathtaking sunsets and delicate pink hues created an indescribable atmosphere. My primary objective was to stay active, immerse myself in nature, and, most importantly, take time off screens to truly connect with the natural world.
<br>
<br>
* Regarding the debate of hiking in the **morning versus the afternoon**, I discovered that afternoons offered better chances of finding parking spots. I had always believed that mornings were the optimal time for hiking, but it turns out I was mistaken. Afternoons meant fewer crowds and readily available parking.
<br>
<br>
* I usually opted for hikes that had **moderate to light foot traffic,** avoiding heavily crowded ones, unless I visited on weekdays.
<br>
<br>
* **Longer hikes mean fewer people.** I noticed that longer hikes tended to have fewer people. Even when the parking lots were full, I rarely encountered more than ten individuals on such trails. I appreciated the tranquility and solitude of these hikes more.
<br>
<br>
* I heavily rely on **Alltrails** for its invaluable insights. While it's a fantastic resource, **I've noticed a slight variation in trail measurements**â€”usually around 0.1 miles off, with minimal discrepancies in elevation gain. The free version of the app proved to be quite useful for navigating through all of these trails.
<br>
<br>

If you're seeking outdoor activities to stay active, I've gathered a collection of excellent options for you. Below is a comprehensive list of hikes, complete with pertinent information and links to their respective AllTrails pages. All the trails mentioned in this list are either out-and-back or loop trails, except for the Dipsea Trail, which is a point-to-point trail, meaning it doesn't conclude at the same starting point.


*Happy Trails!*

# Hard Trails
{: id="hardTrails"}

<br>

1. [Berry Creek Falls Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/berry-creek-falls-trail)*- 13 miles, Elev Gain 2400 ft*
<br> This trail spans a distance of 13 miles, offering a moderately challenging terrain that provides ample shade along the way. It's an excellent choice for a workout hike but be prepared as it can be strenuous. My completion time was 4 hours and 13 minutes, so ensure you have snacks and enough water to keep you fueled throughout the journey. It's advisable to carry a trail map with you as taking a wrong turn or detour could increase both the distance and time, further intensifying the hike. While the trail offers plenty of shade, it's important to note that it can still get quite hot during summer. Therefore, I strongly recommend bringing an ample water supply to stay hydrated throughout the hike. I had the opportunity to hike this trail before it was significantly affected by wildfires. Unfortunately, the trail had to be closed for an extended period due to the damage caused, but now it has reopened. Previously, it was a picturesque route, but now there have been reports of several burnt-down trees from a few individuals who have ventured through the area.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available (there are many parking lots nearby as well), Entrance fee - $6<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available<br>
<mark>Condition:</mark> Lots of shade<br>
<mark>Location:</mark> *[Big Basin Redwoods State Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=540)*<br>
<br>
2. [Fall Creek and Lost Empire Trail Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/fall-creek)*- 11.5 miles, Elev Gain 2200 ft*
<br>In my opinion, I found this trail to be more challenging compared to the Berry Creek Falls trail, despite being labeled as "moderate" on AllTrails. (Update: I completed this trail in June 2020 when it was categorized as moderate, but as of June 2023, it has been reclassified as hard. Additionally, the route I took back then was slightly different, strictly following AllTrails, spanning 11.5 miles. However, there is now a shorter route available, measuring 9.8 miles.) The segments where you walk alongside the stream amidst the magnificent redwoods during the first two and last two miles of the loop are truly awe-inspiring. The scenery is absolutely stunning. Once again, make sure to bring an ample supply of water and food, and don't forget to download an offline map.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Park in the staging area off of Felton Empire Rd, no fee if you start your trail from here<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> No restrooms in the Fall Creek Unit, but there are some at the State Park Visitor (2 miles away)<br>
<mark>Condition:</mark> Lots of shade <br>

<br>
3. [Mount Diablo Grand Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mount-diablo-grand-loop)*- 7 mile, Elev Gain 2,000 ft*
<br> It's a challenging hike with lots of elevation. The trail commences with a downhill stretch, followed by a relentless and arduous ascent towards the summit of Mt. Diablo. Be prepared for narrow passages at certain points along the way, adding an extra element of thrill. Opting to undertake the hike clockwise on a tranquil Sunday evening proved to be a wise choice, as I encountered few fellow hikers. Ample parking was conveniently accessible at the Diablo Valley Overlook. The vistas throughout the journey were absolutely splendid, treating us to breathtaking scenery. Fortunately, I reached the summit just in the nick of time to witness a truly magnificent sunset. This hike is an absolute must for outdoor enthusiasts in Bay Area!<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, Vehicle Entrance Fee $10<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available<br>
<mark>Condition:</mark> Partly shaded <br>
<mark>Location:</mark> *[Mount Diablo State Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=517)*<br>
<br>
4. [Mitchell Canyon and Eagle Peak Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/eagle-peak-loop)*- 8.3 mile, Elev Gain 2,200 ft*
<br>The hike actually spans 8.3 miles, contrary to the incorrect measurement of 7.7 miles reported by AllTrails. It is moderately challenging with intermittent shade. I hiked in a counterclockwise direction, encountering a gradual ascent but facing a rather treacherous downhill section. The descent featured a couple of very steep segments and loose gravel, which made me regret not having hiking poles. It proved to be tough on the knees, and unfortunately, I even took a fall on the gravel portion. Fortunately, I escaped without any serious injury. Therefore, I strongly recommend hiking poles specifically for the descent. The initial 3 miles of the hike provided refreshing shade. I started this hike at approximately 4:00 pm and completed it in around 3 hours and 40 minutes. Encountering only a few individuals at the trailhead, I had the trail mostly to ourselves. Remember to bring a pen and some cash as self-registration is necessary for parking.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, Vehicle Entrance Fee $10<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available<br>
<mark>Condition:</mark> Shaded first 3 miles, Loose gravel, carry hiking poles<br>
