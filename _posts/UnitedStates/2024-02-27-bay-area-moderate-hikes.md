Discover Bay Area's Hidden Gems with me as Your Trail Guide!


Let me be your guide to the hidden treasures of the Bay Area's breathtaking trails. Having hiked over 150 plus trails in the region, I've not only immersed myself in the diverse landscapes but meticulously documented each trail's nuances to ensure you have the most enriching outdoor experience possible. Whether you're a seasoned hiker or a novice adventurer, my passion is to provide you with detailed insights into each trail's difficulty, terrain, and unique features. From shaded strolls to sun-soaked challenges, I've got you covered.


I’ve had many exciting experiences on these hikes, encountering a myriad of wildlife, from playful bunnies to majestic elk, and even the occasional coyote. On at least six different trails, my encounters included observing fascinating snakes. Beyond the wildlife, one of the highlights of these journeys was the opportunity to explore numerous Bay Area towns for the first time, such as Tiburon, San Anselmo, Livermore, Fairfax, Hayward, Corte Madera, Saratoga, Felton, and Moraga, etc.
Explore the trails with confidence, knowing the best time to visit, the availability of restrooms, parking details, and any associated fees.


For your convenience, I've organized the trails into four categories: [easy](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/bay-area-hikes#easyTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, [moderate](#moderateTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, [hard](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/bay-area-hard-hikes#hardTrails){: .js-no-ajax}, and [walks](https://theoutdoorobserver.com/unitedstates/treks-hikes/casual-strolls-in-bay-area#walks){: .js-no-ajax} based on their difficulty level. The 'walks' section is dedicated to gentle strolls with minimal elevation gain, perfect for those seeking a more relaxed outdoor experience.


I heavily rely on Alltrails for its invaluable insights. While it's a fantastic resource, I've noticed a slight variation in trail measurements—usually around 0.1 miles off, with minimal discrepancies in elevation gain. To provide you with the most latest information, each trail description below includes a link to the corresponding Alltrails page.


Additionally, I've marked the trailheads on a map, categorized according to difficulty level. This feature makes it easier for you to find trails nearest to you or select hikes in a particular area, ensuring a seamless and personalized exploration of the Bay Area's trails.



<b>*While hiking these trails, I made several observations that might be helpful for anyone interested in exploring them:*</b>



* Although some of these hikes may not be visually striking, I purposely timed 90% of them to coincide with sunset, which greatly enhanced the overall ambiance. The breathtaking sunsets and delicate pink hues created an indescribable atmosphere. My primary objective was to stay active and immerse myself in nature.
<br>
<br>
* I usually opted for hikes that had moderate to light foot traffic, avoiding heavily crowded ones unless I visited on weekdays.
<br>
<br>
* Regarding the debate of hiking in the morning versus the afternoon, I discovered that afternoons offered better chances of finding parking spots. I had always believed that mornings were the optimal time for hiking, but it turns out I was mistaken. Afternoons meant fewer crowds and readily available parking.
<br>
<br>
* Longer hikes mean fewer people. I noticed that longer hikes tended to have fewer people. Even when the parking lots were full, I rarely encountered more than ten individuals on such trails. I appreciated the tranquility and solitude of these hikes more.
<br>
<br>
* To locate and keep track of the hikes, I relied on AllTrails. I observed that around 99% of the hikes were actually 0.3 to 0.5 miles longer than what was initially stated on the AllTrails app. The free version of the app proved to be quite useful for navigating through all of these trails.
<br>


If you're seeking outdoor activities to stay active, I've gathered a collection of excellent options for you. Below is a comprehensive list of our hikes, complete with pertinent information and links to their respective AllTrails pages. All the trails mentioned in this list are either out-and-back or loop trails, except for the Dipsea Trail, which is a point-to-point trail, meaning it doesn't conclude at the same starting point.


*Happy Trails!*

# Moderate Trails
{: id="moderateTrails"}
<br>

1. [Tomales Point Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tomales-point-trail)*- 9.7 mile, Elev Gain 1200 ft*
<br>This is one of the best hikes we did in the bay area. The trail is approximately 10 miles long; it is pleasant and easy. Suitable for various levels of hikers. It offers magnificent views of the coastline and ocean. Lots of wildlife as well - from majestic elk and deer to lively coyotes, quail, seals, birds, and rabbits; the trail offers an incredible opportunity to witness the wonders of wildlife up close. A thrilling encounter with a snake and one of the most breathtaking sunsets we've ever seen. Keep in mind there is no shade, so come prepared with sun protection. Some overgrown sections on the trail; otherwise, the conditions as great. Highly recommended!<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, Parking is off the Pierce Point Rd, Free<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> No restrooms, restroom nearby at McClures Beach Trailhead<br>
<mark>Difficulty/Condition:</mark> No Shade<br>

<br>
2. [Rodeo Valley Loop and Slacker Hill ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/rodeo-valley-loop-and-slacker-hill)*- 6.2 miles, Elev Gain 1112 ft*
<br> The trail offers stunning scenic views of the city and the Golden Gate Bridge. It is a moderate trail with a gradual elevation gain. Black Sands Beach via Julian Trail and this trail share the same trailhead. Since it's a loop, you also have the flexibility to start from other trailheads. Despite having lived in the Bay Area for five years, I hadn't visited Slacker Hill until 2020, which I admit was embarrassing :). However, the viewpoint there is absolutely amazing, providing breathtaking vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge, city, ocean, and bay. It's a must-do experience, although it's advisable to avoid weekends due to potential crowds. If you plan to hike on a sunny day, it's essential to bring enough water and sunscreen, as there's minimal shade along the entire trail. For truly memorable moments, I recommend doing the hike during sunrise or sunset, as both offer spectacular views from this trail.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Small parking lot at the trailhead, Free<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available<br>

<br>
3. [Almaden Quicksilver McAbee Mine Trail New Almaden Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/almaden-quicksilver-mcabee-mine-trail-new-almaden-trail) *- 13.5 miles, Elev Gain 2300 ft*
<br>The trail route has undergone changes since our hike in 2020. When we did it, the trail measured around 9.8 miles with an elevation gain of 1700 feet. The trailhead used to be located at the end of McAbee Rd, and some people still follow the old route (if you want to check out the old route, visit the activities section on AllTrails and search for activities dated before 2021). However, there is now a new trailhead that has a restroom and a parking lot, which is a welcome improvement. During our hike, parking was limited, requiring us to park off the street, and there were no restroom facilities available.<br>
Regardless of the route you choose, it's advisable to avoid weekends due to the heavy trail traffic. We opted for a weekday hike, and it turned out to be perfect in terms of crowd levels. Additionally, I recommend selecting an overcast day for the hike, as the sun can be quite intense on a long hike like this. It's best to steer clear of hot summer days.
While on the trail, we enjoyed nice views and got a good workout. It's worth noting that there was a mountain lion warning at the trailhead, so it's essential to remain vigilant. <br><br>

<br>
4. [Old Springs, Miwok, Wolf Ridge, Coastal and Tennessee Valley Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/old-springs-miwok-wolf-ridge-coastal-and-tennessee-valley-loop)*- 4.9 miles, Elev Gain 920 ft*
<br>The trail presents awe-inspiring vistas that encompass San Francisco, Rodeo Beach, Tennessee Valley, the vast ocean, and the surrounding landscape. It has several steep but not too bad. It also has an intriguing point of interest: the abandoned Nike missile site. Sharing the same trailhead as the Tennessee Valley trail, this route sees less foot traffic on weekdays, although the parking lot can still fill up. It appears that most visitors are drawn to Tennessee Beach and other hikes originating from this trailhead. However, during our hike, we encountered only a few fellow hikers, providing a more secluded experience. It's important to note that the trail offers no shade, so it's advisable to bring ample water and sunscreen for sun protection. For a less crowded weekday hike, this trail comes highly recommended.<br><br>

<br>
5. [Bootjack Trail Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/bootjack-trail-loop?ref=result-card)*- 6.3 miles, Elev Gain 1,151 ft*
<br>Instead of beginning at the Muir Woods parking lot, we opted to start our hike from the Pantoll Campground. This alternative route added approximately half a mile and 200 feet of elevation to the trail. However, the convenience of starting from Pantoll was unbeatable as it didn't require a Muir Woods Parking Permit for hiking. The scenery was absolutely breathtaking, especially because we went on this hike after a bout of rainfall. The creeks were brimming with water, forming charming little waterfalls along the way. The forest floor was adorned with vibrant ferns and delicate wildflowers, painting a picture-perfect scene of natural beauty. A must-do!<br><br>

6. [Seaborg and Mariposa Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/seaborg-and-mariposa-loop-trail)*- 7.5 mile, Elev Gain 1500 ft*
<br>This moderately challenging trail is an excellent choice for anyone seeking an invigorating workout amidst beautiful natural surroundings. The trail spans a good distance and offers a mix of inclines that really get your heart pumping and your calves burning, but the rewarding views make every step worthwhile. Interestingly, we didn't come across any fellow hikers on the trail except for a few individuals in the parking lot. The solitude provided a tranquil and serene experience as if we had the entire trail to ourselves. We did it around sunset, and the enchanting pink hues of the sky, complemented by the magnificent backdrop of Mt. Diablo, created a truly remarkable scene.<br><br>

<br>
7. [King Canyon Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/kings-canyon-loop-trail)*- 7.3 mile, Elev Gain 1000 ft*
<br>According to AllTrails, the trail measures 6.4 miles; however, my own tracking showed 7.32 miles on AllTrails and 7.1 miles on my watch, suggesting that the actual distance is likely longer than the listed 6.4 miles. Surprisingly, despite doing it on a Sunday afternoon, the trail was not crowded. The overcast and chilly weather conditions in November might have contributed to the fewer hikers we encountered. It's a pretty hike, with nice views of the reservoir and the surrounding area. It's quite tranquil, likely due to the absence of large crowds. However, be cautious of sun exposure if you end up going on a sunny day.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, You need a trail Permit to hike; it's $3 per day. Trail permit holders can take members of their immediate family and 3 guests. Purchase it *[here.](https://www.ebmud.com/recreation/buy-trail-permit)*<br>

8. [Hazelnut Trail and Weiler Ranch Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/hazelnut-trail-and-weiler-ranch-loop)*- 4.7 miles, Elev gain 900 ft*
<br> This hike is moderately challenging and has partial shade along the way. It's not particularly challenging, but it's enough to get your heart rate up and work up a light sweat. The first half involves a decent uphill section followed by a downhill stretch in the second half. You'll pass through a beautiful eucalyptus grove, and you'll find a lot of bunnies along the trail. It's important to note that the park gate closes at sunset, but street parking is available outside. Please be cautious, as there is a warning of mountain lion sightings at the trailhead.<br><br>

9. [Black Sands Beach via Julian Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/black-sands-beach-via-julian-trail)*- 4.2 mile*
<br> This trail in Marin Headlands offers a moderate level of difficulty. There are steep sections along the way, and you'll need to navigate stairs to access the beautiful black sand beach. The trailhead is shared with Rodeo Valley Loop and Slacker Hill. I hiked it on a weekday, so it was pleasantly quiet. The stunning black sand beach makes it a must-visit destination.<br><br>

<br>
10. [Los Trancos Trail Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/los-trancos-trail-loop)*- 7.7 mile, Elev gain 1500 ft*
<br> This is a moderately easy hike and offers a wonderful opportunity for forest bathing. I absolutely adored it, particularly the heavenly scent of the trees after the rains. It was a therapeutic experience, connecting to the calming and revitalizing energy of nature. The trail has a gentle and gradual elevation gain.<br><br>

<br>
11. [Castle Rocks Lower Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/castle-rocks-lower-loop)*- 6.5 mile, Elev Gain 1200 ft*
<br> The trail, spanning a distance of 6.5 miles, is remarkable in its beauty and quality. However, it tends to attract a significant amount of foot traffic until it intersects with the Interconnector Trail. This popularity often leads to heavy congestion. When we did it, it came to a complete halt for approximately 15 minutes, with a queue of at least 30 people forming. Surprisingly, beyond that juncture, the trail becomes devoid of any human presence. It appears that most individuals opt for alternative trails, which is why I would recommend avoiding this particular route on weekends. Some scrambling skills are required around boulders. Cable rails have been installed along certain sections to help hikers. It's worth noting that the last two miles of the trail are accompanied by the somewhat bothersome background noise from a nearby gun range. Nonetheless, the hike itself is truly exceptional, especially when accompanied by excellent weather. The views along the Saratoga Gap trail are nothing short of breathtaking.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, $10 entry fee<br>

<br>
12. [White Hill Fire Road ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/white-hill-fire-road)*- 7.5 mile, Elev Gain 1300 ft*
<br>The distance was approximately 7.5 miles, but AllTrails displays an incorrect measurement of 6.5 miles, which is significantly off. The hike is of moderate difficulty and surprisingly not crowded. However, there are only a few parking spaces available. Good mix of forest & open areas. Once you're about a mile from the trailhead, you'll need to take the Porcupine Trail, which connects with the White Hill Fire Road. Unfortunately, the suggested route on AllTrails is closed. Instead, the Porcupine Trail merges with the White Hill Fire Road approximately 0.3 miles ahead. It could become really hot on a sunny day. Nevertheless, with proper planning(enough water & sun protection) and timing, this hike could be enjoyable<br><br>

<br>
13. [Ring Mountain Fire Road ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/ring-mountain-fire-road)*- 4.7 mile, Elev gain 880 ft*
<br>Alltrails incorrectly show 4.1 miles, it is 4.7 miles, also, it is more than 800ft in elevation gain, not 669ft as stated on AllTrails. Amazing views of the city and bay! The only downside is there is no parking at the trailhead, so you need to park somewhere down the street.<br><br>

14. [Rambler, Ohlone, Chaparral, Berry, Lake, John Brooks and Lower Finch Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/rambler-ohlone-chaparral-berry-lake-john-brooks-and-lower-finch-loop)*- 7.4 mile, Elev gain 1380 ft*
<br>I give this trail only two stars solely for its breathtaking panoramic views. However, I must point out that the trail's length is not accurately stated as 6.7 miles; it is actually more than 7.4 miles with an elevation gain of 1380 ft. Moreover, the downhill sections of the trail were incredibly challenging and unpleasant. I highly advise wearing hiking shoes to navigate the trail safely. In addition to the aforementioned concerns, another issue with the trail was the unreliable mapping on AllTrails, which often deviated from the actual route. Furthermore, there were, so many bifurcations that you are most of the time on phone figuring out which way to go. It's important to note that this trail is primarily designed for biking and may not be ideal for hiking.<br><br>

15. [Tennessee Valley to Alta Ridge Loop ](hhttps://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tennessee-valley-to-alta-ridge-loop?search=true)*- 5.5 mile, Elev gain 1168 ft*
<br>This hiking trail that offers a perfect blend of coastal beauty and scenic landscapes. This trail that begins a mile before the Tennessee Valley Trailhead.
Setting off from the designated starting point, just before the Tennessee Valley Trailhead, the trail immediately immerses you in a world of lush greenery and captivating scenery. The initial stretch showcases a picturesque valley adorned with wildflowers and tall grasses.
A significant highlight of this hike is the point where the trail intersects with the Alta Trail, leading you to the ridge line. While the ascent presents a moderate challenge, the rewards are unparalleled. Reaching the top unveils a stunning vista encompassing the Golden Gate Bridge, the iconic San Francisco skyline, and the vast expanse of the ocean. This vantage point is a perfect spot to rest, reflect, and appreciate the wonders of nature. Furthermore, the section which connects Alta Trail intersects with Miwok Trail presents some concerns, as it features precarious footing due to loose rocks and a steep incline.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Available, park off Tennessee Valley Rd, alternatively you can park at Tennessee Valley Trailhead Parking Lot, and start the hike from there.<br>
<mark>Restrooms:</mark> Available, Vault toilet at Tennessee Valley Trailhead<br>

<br>The trail crosses the beautiful Tafoni formations.*(The structures covering the sandstone are called Tafoni, which is Italian for the cavern. Thousands of years of complex weathering processes created the caves, columns, and sandy surfaces that are smooth in some areas and covered with labyrinths of knobs and ridges in others.)* There are a few sections on this trail that are quite steep, and one section in particular that is super super steep. It is highly recommended to follow the clockwise route as suggested by AllTrails, as attempting to descend the super steep section without hiking poles would be extremely challenging. It is well marked and maintained! Good for forest bathing.<br><br>

17. [McNee Ranch to Planet of the Apes ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mcnee-ranch-to-planet-of-the-apes)*- 5.8 miles, Elev Gain 1266 ft*
<br>Nice hike! There were a few steep sections that required caution, especially when descending. It is highly recommended to wear appropriate footwear, such as hiking shoes, to ensure stability. The trailhead on Highway 1 has limited parking, accommodating only around six cars. Alternatively, parking at Montara State Beach, which is a short distance of 0.2 miles from the trailhead, is a viable option. It's worth noting that the distance reported on AllTrails is inaccurate, as the hike measured approximately 5.8 miles when done counterclockwise. This route can be considered moderately difficult in that direction. Our choice to hike on a weekday evening offered the delightful bonus of witnessing a stunning sunset over the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>
<mark>Parking:</mark> Limited for about only six cars, the alternate option to park at nearby Montara Beach (0.2 miles), No fee<br>

18. [High Ridge Loop Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/high-ridge-loop-trail)*- 5.8 mile, Elev Gain 1,223 ft*
<br>There are countless scenic views to behold along this trail.  As you reach higher elevations, you'll be rewarded with sweeping vistas of the entire Bay Area. These breathtaking views serve as a reminder of the beauty of the Bay Area and add an extra touch of magic to the hiking experience. The trail is well-maintained, with clearly defined paths and occasional benches for hikers to rest and take in the surroundings. We did it on an overcast day and it was gorgeous. While AllTrails may classify it as a hard trail, in my opinion, it falls more into the moderate difficulty range. It's important to mention that there is no shade and it is totally exposed to the sun.
With proper planning (plenty of water and sunscreen) and timing, this hike could be easily done. A must-do!<br><br>

19. [Slate Creek Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/slate-creek-loop)*- 5.4 miles, Elev Gain 1043 ft*
<br>One of the most striking aspects of the Slate Creek Loop Trail is the dense redwood forest that envelops you from the moment you set foot on the trail. Towering trees create a serene and tranquil atmosphere, providing a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The shade offered by these ancient giants makes it an ideal hike even on hot summer days. As you make your way along the trail, you'll encounter several picturesque spots that are perfect for pausing and soaking in the natural beauty. These include scenic viewpoints, moss-covered bridges, and even the remnants of an old homestead, adding a touch of history to the hike. The diversity of flora and fauna along the trail is impressive, providing ample opportunities for nature enthusiasts and photographers to capture breathtaking moments. No/Poor cell reception within the park and the surrounding area, so I would advise to download offline maps before hitting the trail. A must-do!<br><br>

20. [North Peak via Montara Mountain Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/north-peak-via-montara-mountain-trail)*- 7 mile, Elev Gain 1,677 ft*
<br>The climb is a steady incline. It was astonishing to begin our journey around 8:00 am on a Sunday and encounter only a handful of individuals along the trail. The scenery is absolutely stunning as it has both the bay and the ocean. I highly suggest undertaking this hike; however, keep in mind that the sun can become intense as the day progresses, so it's advisable to schedule your hike for either early morning or late afternoon.<br><br>

21. [Rodeo Beach, Coastal Trail and Miwok Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/rodeo-beach-coastal-trail-and-miwok-trail)*- 5.3 miles, Elevation Gain 1,076 ft*
<br>The trail begins at Rodeo Beach, which is a stunning expanse of golden sand bordered by rugged cliffs. The views of the Pacific Ocean are simply breathtaking, with crashing waves and a refreshing sea breeze. The beach is a great spot for picnicking, sunbathing, or even some beachcombing. The trail itself is well-maintained and moderately challenging, making it accessible to hikers of various skill levels. There are also several lookout points along the way that provide panoramic vistas of the Marin Headlands, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the San Francisco skyline in the distance. There are a couple of steep climbs, but they are manageable. We did it on a Sunday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to find the trail relatively empty, despite the beach being swarmed with people. The parking lot is expansive, and finding a spot was a breeze.

22. [San Pedro Beach to Devil's Slide ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/san-pedro-beach-to-devil-s-slide)*- 6.7 miles, Elev Gain 1,115 ft*
<br> This Pacifica trail offers a mix of coastal beauty and diverse terrain. The paved sections, while not everyone's favorite, are balanced by stunning views and varying landscapes. Despite some drawbacks, like proximity to the highway, this trail offers great views. The starting point may be challenging to find, but the spectacular coastal views and inclines are worth the effort. The trail's entrance might be tricky to find, but once on the path, expect gorgeous coastal vistas, occasional encounters with poison oak, and the occasional foggy day. A must-do hike for Bay Area enthusiasts.<br><br>

23. [Lafayette Reservoir and Rim Trail Loop ](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/lafayette-reservoir-and-rim-trail-loop)*- 4 mile, Elev Gain 595 ft*
<br>This trail, situated close to Moraga, offers a moderate experience with minimal shade. Featuring a couple of steep segments, I suggest doing it counterclockwise to avoid navigating a particularly steep downhill section in the final stretch. It is very steep, I recommend using hiking poles & shoes with good grip, in case you decide to do clockwise. Keep in mind that free parking is limited, accommodating only four cars. Alternatively you can park inside the park for $7.
<br>
**Note** - Sometime harmful algae present in Lafayette Reservoir, while activities near the water, such as picnicking, biking, and hiking, are safe. Take the following precautions for your safety - Body contact with water is never permitted. Keep children away from the water and the shoreline. Use tap water to rinse any skin that has contacted lake water. - Keep pets, especially dogs, out of the water. They should neither enter nor drink the water.

<br>Fantastic shaded trail adorned with ferns, creek crossings, culminating in a stunning viewpoint at the Inn. The trail was pleasantly uncrowded during our Sunday evening hike, and parking was a breeze to find, but could get busy during the day. Clocking in at around 4 miles with over 800 feet of elevation gain (note that AllTrails may provide different statistics), it's wise to plan accordingly.<br><br>

<br>Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park is a hidden sanctuary of redwood forest, just a stone's throw from downtown Oakland. Definitely a moderate trail; the elevation gain is steep in certain parts. You walk through the forest almost from start to finish — plenty of vegetation. The network of trails in this park caters to all levels of outdoor enthusiasts, from leisurely walkers to avid hikers, providing an opportunity to witness the grandeur of these majestic trees.

<br>A comfortably shaded hike through the woods with a moderate level of difficulty. Commencing from Skeggs Point on Skyline Boulevard, the trail is well-kept and is a pleasant experience. While the last mile was a bit of a grind, but there were no steep sections as such, though it is frequented by many bikers. I always enjoy forest hikes, so definitely consider this one if you're in search of some rejuvenating forest therapy.<br><br>

<br>As I so much love forest hikes, El Corte Madera Creek Preserve is always a pleasure to hike. The well-defined trails and the lush expanse of the dense forest adds to the overall hiking experience. There are a few steep downhill sections on this trail, but the uphill portions are gradual, ensuring a manageable ascent. The trailhead has limited parking space, so if you plan to hike on weekends, it's advisable to begin in the afternoon to secure a spot. The trail is also popular among bikers.<br>

28. [Fort Point - Baker Beach Coast Trail ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/fort-point-baker-beach-coast-trail)*- 4 mile, Elevation Gain 850 ft*
<br>The Fort Point - Baker Beach Coast Trail seamlessly combines history and nature. Beginning at the historic Fort Point beneath the Golden Gate Bridge, the trail offers stunning views of the bridge, bay, and Pacific Ocean. The terrain is easy and suitable for all hikers, although be prepared for lots of stairs along the way. Ample signage and informational plaques provide insights into the historical significance of Fort Point and the surrounding areas.<br>
Keep in mind that the weather along the coast can be unpredictable, so it's advisable to dress in layers and be prepared for brisk winds. Additionally, weekends may attract more visitors, so planning a weekday visit can enhance the overall experience.<br>
If you live in San Francisco or are visiting the city, I highly recommend doing this trail.<br><br>

<br>I really enjoyed this trail—it was super green with a nice forest smell. The hike through the wooded canyons was mostly easy, except for a bit of a steep part. The redwoods and the creeks were cool. The only downside was the last mile and a half on the road. It's a great pick for a warm day hike!<br><br>

<br>One of the highlights of this trail is the presence of redwoods in Joaquin Miller Park, considered a rare gem thriving in an urban setting. It is a shaded haven of redwood groves and oak woodlands. The dense canopy of trees providing much-needed shade throughout the journey, making it perfect for a sunny day. It is moderately challenging but it is accessible to a wide range of fitness levels, offering a balanced challenge without overwhelming those seeking a leisurely outdoor activity. Must-do!<br><br>

31. [Horseshoe Lake, Alpine Pond and Borel Hill](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/horseshoe-lake-alpine-pond-borel-hill)*- 6.2 miles, Elev Gain 1080 ft*
<br>This trail is a great place for a hike along Skyline Boulevard. I suggest going on a cloudy day because most of the trail is out in the open. This way, it's not too hot, and you can enjoy the surroundings better. The ascend was gradual, it's a nice option for those who want a moderate outdoor activity without too much difficulty. The best part is when you reach the top of Borel Hill. Breathtaking panoramic views of the bay and everything around. When I went, fog started rolling in, making the scene even more special. The mist added a magical touch to the whole experience, making it really memorable. Just pick a day with some clouds, and you'll have a great time, especially if the fog decides to join in.

<br>The Valley View, Weiler Ranch, and Hazelnut Trail Loop at San Pedro Valley Park is definitely worth exploring. Gradual ascents and descents, nothing drastic, keep your heart pumping. What I love the most about this trail is that you pass through a grove of Eucalyptus trees; it smells heavenly. I have done this trail twice and would definitely go back again to enjoy that scent. The trailhead is easily accessible, with ample parking available. There are also informative signs along the way, providing interesting tidbits about the local flora and fauna. Keep in mind that the park closes at sunset, so if you wish, you can park your car outside on the street.<br><br>

<br>I recently explored the trail in El Corte Madera Preserve on Skyline Blvd, and it was fantastic! The trail is through a dense forest, which was very serene and calming. What stood out to me the most was the variety of mushrooms I saw along the way. The entire trail is like a green paradise, perfect for immersing yourself in nature.

<br>I would classify this trail as moderate difficulty, leaning towards the easier side due to the gradual incline. The uphill is quite gradual, and I officially categorize it as moderate primarily because of the total amount of elevation gain. One of the standout features of this trail is its stunning natural surroundings - lush greenery, tall trees, and beautiful wildflowers that also makes it shaded thoughout. Just a heads up, the park gates close at 7:00 pm.<br><br>

<br>If you enjoy hiking on shaded trails, this might not be the perfect hike for you. The route is a combination of sunlight and shade, so it's advisable to bring sufficient water and sun protection. Despite the heat during our hike on a partly cloudy day, the trail was lovely, panoramic views at the top and an abundance of wildflowers. Opting for weekdays can offer a quieter and more serene environment as there are usually fewer people on the trail.<br>
Note -"On 11/26/2023, two hikers with dogs at the preserve after hours were followed by coyotes for several miles. The hikers and their dogs were not harmed. Visitors that hike with dogs may want to consider alternative activities, or locations for the time being."<br><br>

<br>Nice, well-kept path with lots of shade. I found a really pretty hike in Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve. It's kind of like Muir Woods, with everything super green and beautiful. The initial portion of the trail descends gracefully, while the latter part involves an uphill climb. Be prepared for some moderately steep segments, totaling 1200 feet over a slightly more than 2-mile distance. This is one of my favorite trails in the Bay Area. Those gentle whispers of the rustling leaves and the earthy fragrance of the forest floor, I loved every bit of it. Must-do!<br><br>

<br>I love hiking in the Redwood Regional Park, especially considering its convenient location near the city and the rich, dense forest it offers. The trail is well-kept, with ample shade provided by tall redwood trees. If you do it during the day, the sunlight peeks through the leaves, making it so pretty. The trail gets its name because it runs alongside a calm little creek. You'll cross a few small bridges over the creek, the sound of the running water make it more serene.<br><br>

Best for forest bathing - you take a break, breathe in the fresh air, and let the nature vibes sink in. The well-maintained path meanders through a lush forest, which is home to second-growth redwoods. Elevation gain is actually higher than that stated on Alltrails. You have the option to park along the Skyline Boulevard (there is hardly any space to park)<br><br>

The hike provides a spectacular 360-degree perspective. It's a pleasant hike with a mildly moderate difficulty level, featuring some sections with steps.
